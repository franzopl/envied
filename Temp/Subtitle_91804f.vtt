STEPHEN MANGAN:
'Previously on The Fortune Hotel...'

00:04.640 --> 00:06.960
What's that?
Don't know what it is.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.000
'..Gary and Lesley were reunited
with an old friend...'

00:09.000 --> 00:11.960
Who's given us that, then, I wonder?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.960
'..an enticing twist
raised suspicions.'

00:14.960 --> 00:17.480
The pair
who are left holding the fortune

00:17.480 --> 00:23.960
at the end of the Nightcap
will withdraw and pocket £10,000.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.800
'Aysha and Samm, you had the money.'

00:27.800 --> 00:30.960
You've made it so obvious,
and we're watching you.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.960
'Fortune Holders Will and Jo
felt under pressure.'

00:33.960 --> 00:36.640
Would you mind
if we swapped with you?

00:36.640 --> 00:38.960
Cos I'm just thinking
that we're a target.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.960
'A thrilling challenge saw Dan
and Claire holding all the power.'

00:43.960 --> 00:47.480
You get to pick
the entire swapping order later.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.960
'At the Nightcap, Will and Jo
reluctantly passed on the fortune.'

00:51.960 --> 00:55.640
I think everybody were thinking,
"Mm, have Jo and Will got it?".

00:55.640 --> 00:58.960
'Aysha and Samm were handed
the Early Checkout Card,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.960
'which left them
with a huge decision to make.'

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
If you give me the Checkout Card,
I'll be pissed off,

01:03.960 --> 01:05.960
so I might as well
just take you out.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.960
I could give his briefcase
to someone strong.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.960
'But who will they send packing?'

01:20.960 --> 01:24.960
MUSIC: 'Be Careful
What You Wish For' by NineOneOne

01:26.960 --> 01:28.960
Aysha and Samm, you're next up.
What are you gonna do?

01:28.960 --> 01:31.960
Are you gonna stick?
Are you gonna swap?

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
I know what's there.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.960
I don't know what's here,
and I don't trust that guy.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.160
We want our case back.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.960
# I wish everything would stop

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
# Let me breathe... #
OK, go get it.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.960
# Just let me breathe... #

01:56.960 --> 01:59.960
We tried to get rid of the card.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.960
And I didn't even give it a thought
it might come back again.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.960
There are just two couples left.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.960
Dan and Claire, you're in control.
Who's going next?

02:09.960 --> 02:13.960
It would be foolhardy
for us not to go last.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.320
So I hope you don't mind,

02:15.320 --> 02:17.960
but we have selected
Tommy and Scott next.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.960
Tommy and Scott...
what are you two gonna do?

02:22.960 --> 02:25.960
I think we're gonna swap
with Will and Jo-Anne.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.960
So you're taking
Adam and Michael's original case.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
Why are you doing that?

02:33.960 --> 02:35.960
I've just got a good feeling
about it, a bit of a hunch.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.800
Great, OK. Do it. Thank you.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.960
Dan and Claire, final swap or stick
is in your hands.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.960
We've decided
to start taking some risks.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.960
We are going to swap...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.960
..with Samm and Aysha.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.960
Busy night for you two. Let's swap.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.960
Samm and Aysha got their case back
from Gary and Lesley.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
If they were the Fortune Holders,

03:15.960 --> 03:18.480
then they'd absolutely want
that money back.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.320
JAE: 'I bet you
Dan and Claire have the money.'

03:21.320 --> 03:23.960
It's time to learn your fortunes.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.320
Couples with a new case,
come up and check what's inside.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.960
Gary and Lesley.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.960
Michael and Adam.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.960
'They don't know we've had the money
the whole time we've been here.'

03:54.960 --> 03:57.960
'Oh, God, they're never gonna talk
to us again.'

03:59.960 --> 04:01.480
'Oh, my goodness.'

04:01.480 --> 04:02.960
There was no way in a million years

04:02.960 --> 04:04.960
we thought 250 grand
was gonna be in that case.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.960
THEY CHUCKLE SOFTLY

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
We're lucky we laugh all the time.
Yeah.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.960
Cos then at least it looks
like we're doing the same thing.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.960
It's time to find out

04:15.960 --> 04:18.960
who will be leaving
The Fortune Hotel this evening.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.960
Can the holders
of the Early Checkout Card

04:23.960 --> 04:26.960
please reveal themselves?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.480
Whoo! It's us.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.160
I'm sorry to see you both go.
Thank you.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.480
Yeah, we're obviously sorry
to see us go. Yeah.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.960
CHUCKLING

04:38.960 --> 04:41.960
But, you know, I'm a bit of a loser.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.960
But with Lesley by your side,
you're definitely a winner, mate.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
ALL: Aww.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.960
You guys have been a pleasure
to share The Fortune Hotel with.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.960
Thank you. You're about to swap
Egyptian cotton sheets

04:51.960 --> 04:53.960
for a pair of window seats.
THEY CHUCKLE

04:53.960 --> 04:57.960
Please leave your case
and leave The Fortune Hotel.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.640
# I, I

05:01.640 --> 05:03.960
# I know that you did it... #

05:03.960 --> 05:06.960
'Well, we said we would get rid of
the Early Checkout Card

05:06.960 --> 05:08.160
'a second time.'
'And we did.'

05:08.160 --> 05:10.960
And technically, we did.
We just got it back.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.960
We just didn't get rid of it
the third time.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Taxi to England.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.000
Well done to the Fortune Holders.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.960
You are going to bed £10,000 richer,

05:21.960 --> 05:24.960
and you will also be deciding
the fate

05:24.960 --> 05:27.960
of where this card goes next.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.960
Thank you. Good night.
ALL: Good night.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.960
I don't like looking
at Adam's reactions.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.960
He gave me a few looks in there.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
I don't know if he's...
I don't know if he's just confused.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.160
He was most probably thinking,
"Why have they given it us?

05:47.160 --> 05:48.960
"Why haven't they kept it?"

05:48.960 --> 05:51.960
Our closest allies,
we didn't even know had the money.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.960
'The thing is, Jo and Will have...'

05:53.960 --> 05:55.960
They've essentially given us
ten grand.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
They've basically given us
ten grand.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.960
'But we can't fully trust them,
can we?'

05:58.960 --> 06:01.320
'Not yet. No.
'Not at this stage.'

06:02.960 --> 06:04.960
THEY CHUCKLE SOFTLY

06:08.960 --> 06:11.960
That's ten grand. Smell it.
That's ten grand, mate.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.960
HE INHALES,
CHUCKLES

06:13.960 --> 06:16.960
The money has been under our nose
the whole time.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.960
We didn't even know we've had it.
It's sitting there.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.960
We're thinking we're going home,
and then we're ending up,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
we've got 250 grand
in our possession,

06:22.960 --> 06:24.480
and we've banked 10K.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.960
And now we've got to start
thinking about this card.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.960
This is horrible now.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.960
We need to give it
to the weakest pairings. Yeah.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.960
On related tasks at the moment,
the weakest pairings are...

06:40.960 --> 06:42.960
Samm and Aysha.
Samm and Aysha and...

06:42.960 --> 06:44.960
BOTH: Jae and Cherish.
Yeah.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.960
Either of them two pairings...

06:47.960 --> 06:52.160
we would like to think we're gonna
get higher than them in challenges.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.960
I wouldn't like to choose
between the two. No.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.960
Oh, God.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.960
I think maybe that's another
rock-paper-scissors one.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.960
OK, so I'll be Samm and Aysha.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.960
And I'll be Jae and Cherish.
OK.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
One, two, three.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.960
One, two, three.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.800
One, two, three.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.480
One, two, three.

07:17.960 --> 07:18.960
It's not a nice thing, is it?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.960
I don't like it.
No.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
Come in.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.960
My God.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.960
They gave it to us.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.960
Mm... that's interesting.
CHUCKLES

07:35.960 --> 07:39.960
Wow, Dan and Claire.
Let the games begin.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
OK, OK.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.480
The game is really on now.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
I thought
you were still asleep then.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.960
Mm-hm.
It took a while to answer.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.800
I thought,
"I bet you're still asleep."

08:10.800 --> 08:11.960
Morning.
Hi.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.960
I was coming.
Morning.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.960
Morning, morning, morning.
Ooh!

08:15.960 --> 08:18.960
Less energy. Less... Less energy.
I'm tired.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.960
How are you feeling?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.960
Just feeling deflated,
to be honest,

08:22.960 --> 08:26.800
because I still think it's
Dan and Claire that gave it to us.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.480
Yeah. I'd really love
to return it back to them.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
CHUCKLING: Yeah.
Karma's a bitch.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.960
Cos I'm not leaving.
Are you leaving?

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
I ain't going nowhere.
I'm not leaving.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
I don't wanna leave.
It's not that time just yet.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.960
My gut's telling me
that Susan and Jen

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
have got the fortune at the moment.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.960
Based on Jen's reaction last night,
the fact that they did stick again.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.960
So if that's the case,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.960
who do we think they've given the
Early Checkout Card to overnight?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
Based on what's happened so far...

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
In the challenges.
..Jae and Cherish.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.160
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.800
It's gonna be interesting as well
how we interact with...

09:00.800 --> 09:01.960
with Jae and Cherish.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.000
I think we just need
to be ourselves. Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.480
Like, I feel bad.
I feel bad, but it's the game.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.160
Yeah.
So we'll just stay sweet with them.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.480
It's not personal, is it?
We've had to pick someone.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.960
We do feel bad about it,
but the name of the game is to...

09:11.960 --> 09:13.960
Is to win, isn't it?
Yeah.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.000
We need to have a chat with
Michael and Adam today when we can.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.160
They're gonna think, "Bloody hell,

09:20.160 --> 09:22.960
"they have proper played a game,"
aren't they? Yeah.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.160
I want them to know...

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
..that they can trust us.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.960
Good morning, guys.
ALL: Good morning.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
How are we all?
Good.

09:39.960 --> 09:44.800
Good, good.
Who do you guys think has the money?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.960
I think Samm and Aysha
had the money.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.960
Mm-hm.
So...

09:48.960 --> 09:50.800
Dan and Claire have it now. Mm.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.960
Yeah. Yeah.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.960
Obviously, we now know
what was in your case,

09:55.960 --> 09:57.960
and you now know
what was in our case.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
So that bonds us a little bit
in the game, doesn't it? Yeah.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.960
Because now there are other people
in the same situation.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.960
Do you feel nervous
about talking to them?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.480
No, unless they've got, like,
some mad idea in their head.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.960
And now you just don't know, do you?
Here they are, look.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
Are they? Ah.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
Have a seat, boys.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Yeah. How are you guys feeling?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.960
Yeah, good.
All right.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.160
The first thing I wanted to say is

10:23.160 --> 10:25.960
I couldn't read your reaction
yesterday when you checked the case.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.640
I thought you were pissed off.
No, we weren't pissed off.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.960
It's worked out.
It has worked out well.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.960
Are you happy, then?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
We've been guessing
where the money is,

10:33.960 --> 10:35.960
and it's been right under our nose
the whole time.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.000
We ain't got a Scooby.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.960
So, do you believe that
Mike and Adam and Will and Jo-Anne

10:41.960 --> 10:44.960
actually knew what they had?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.960
I...
Like, it could be a case of,

10:46.960 --> 10:49.960
"Let's just keep swapping the money
and just getting a 10K each,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.800
"just stacking up."
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Possibly.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.960
We're obviously gonna try
and give you the case back,

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
but in a way...

10:56.960 --> 10:58.960
That isn't obvious.
..that isn't obvious.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.320
'They've given us the case
to take the heat off them.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.960
'We understand that.'

11:02.960 --> 11:05.800
I think our alliance with
Will and Jo-Anne is stronger now.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.960
'I think everyone
just feels reassured.'

11:07.960 --> 11:09.960
I suppose the question is
where's the Early Checkout Card?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
Yeah, we all know...
We're all on the same page.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.800
Obviously, we know, at the moment,

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
Jae and Cherish have got
the Early Checkout Card.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.960
'We do gain a massive advantage

11:17.960 --> 11:20.960
'because we've got all the pieces
to the jigsaw at the moment.'

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
We're in the driving seat.
Yeah.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.960
Good morning.
ALL: Morning.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.000
Hello. How are you all?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.960
Good.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
It was great last night.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.960
There were lots of swaps,
so a lot of new information.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.640
You're getting to know
what's going on,

11:34.640 --> 11:36.960
but obviously, one couple...

11:36.960 --> 11:39.640
are £10,000 richer this morning.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.160
Right, well, can I ask you please
to all return to your rooms

11:45.160 --> 11:47.960
for today's Room Service Challenge?

11:47.960 --> 11:52.960
And please be very careful
because once one falls over,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.960
they all go.
GASPING

11:55.960 --> 11:57.960
Thank you very much.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.960
I feel a big bit of pressure

12:01.960 --> 12:04.480
for us to actually win
this Room Service Challenge.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.960
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Because if we don't,

12:05.960 --> 12:07.960
then we're putting ourselves
under jeopardy.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.960
Someone could come in,
swap our case, take the money.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
'We don't know what's gonna happen.'

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
I think it's very, very important

12:13.960 --> 12:15.960
for us to win
the Room Service Challenge today

12:15.960 --> 12:17.960
because we have
the Early Checkout Card.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.320
'And we're going to get rid of it.'

12:19.320 --> 12:21.960
What do we have here?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.160
Dominoes.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.960
Interesting.
How high we can stack it.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.960
It's a lot in here. Oh.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.960
I think you'll find
that's... check mate.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.480
Hello. As a former British
junior dominoes champion,

12:36.480 --> 12:39.160
I know a thing or two
about shaking the old bones.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.960
'That's a domino term.'

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
I win.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.960
No, you didn't.
HE CHUCKLES

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
He's taking the piss.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.960
"You have ten minutes to build
the highest tower

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
"using only the dominoes provided."

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
How'd you build
a dominoes tower again?

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
"Tallest tower wins."

12:58.960 --> 13:00.960
"Before you start,
please hold hands.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.480
"You must remain..."
What?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.960
"You must remain holding hands
for the entire game."

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
Whoa! You want me to work
with one hand?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.160
What's your strongest hand?

13:10.160 --> 13:11.960
Right.
So is my right.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
Which is your right?
This is my right.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
You want to use your right.
Give me your left hand.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
I'm a lefty, anyway.
What are you, a righty? Yeah.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.960
We'll hold hands,
then we're just sweet. We're good.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.480
That's perfect.
Are we sitting down?

13:21.480 --> 13:22.960
Just chill.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
Trust me, I'm a bricklayer.
I know.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
Time starts now.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.960
Oh, no, don't lose time doing that.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.320
Well, no, but we don't want them
to go all over.

13:31.320 --> 13:35.000
Like this so that it has balance
at all angles.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.800
But we need to build
a foundation as well, Cherish.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.960
Adam and Michael
will be brilliant at this.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.960
Well, he's a bloody bricklayer.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.960
Do six and then link over.
Link over.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
You've got...
Your hands are so soft.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.960
Once you get to five tiles high...

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
Go the other direction.
..go the other direction.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.960
This is intense, you know.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.000
Do we think building a line...

13:55.960 --> 13:58.000
..and going up from that
is the way to go?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.960
Or do you want to go like...?
I think we go flat.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
Flat?!
Yeah.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.480
It feels sturdy already, doesn't it?
Yes, that ain't going nowhere.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.960
It's gonna... It's gonna fall.
OK.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.960
Now I say we go this way.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.960
Yes! You're so smart, Tommy.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.960
Honestly,
it's incredibly attractive.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.960
Put another side beam in there
and then put an end one on.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.960
TV: You have five minutes left.
Oh, my word.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.960
Oh, my word.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.160
Let's not lose sight.
Let's not panic.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.960
Stop moving the table.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.960
If you touch it like that,
just slide them like this.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.480
Put them as close as you can.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.960
There.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.320
I can feel it's all right, mate.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.960
I've built walls in the wind.
It's all good.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.960
"One minute left."
Just build one tower.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.640
Just build the one I'm building.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.960
No, no, no,
just individually because....

14:47.960 --> 14:50.160
No, just individually.
Listen to what I'm saying.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.960
My hands are shaking...
Do you want me to do it?

14:52.960 --> 14:53.960
..so badly.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.160
No, no. It's cool, it's cool.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.960
Yeah, let's stack.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.960
Just stack one on top of the other
like you were originally gonna do.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
Mm, mm!
No, no, no.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.960
Push it that way.
Push it. Push it to me.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.160
OK, OK. Right. Level it up, then.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.960
Level it up. Argh!

15:10.640 --> 15:12.800
Right, now, just trust me on this.
Trust me on this.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.960
Just trust me on this.
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.960
No, don't do any more.
Don't do any more.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.960
Oh, eight seconds.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.960
Eight. Seven. Six.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.960
Ugh, ugh, no, the whole thing shook!

15:25.960 --> 15:28.320
I'm only gonna balance one.
OK.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.960
Argh! You're doing it too fast!

15:29.960 --> 15:30.960
Leave it that.
Leave it at that.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.960
Lay it down. Just lay it down.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
I think we leave it.
I think we leave it.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.960
Right, come away.
HE CHUCKLES

15:39.160 --> 15:40.960
Mate, that's fucking high.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.640
I don't think
anyone's building higher.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.960
You think that's high enough?
Nah.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.960
Oh!
"You lost. Better luck next time."

15:51.960 --> 15:53.960
Shall I... Can I...? Can I just...?
Womp, womp, womp.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
There's a surprise.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.160
SHE LAUGHS

16:02.960 --> 16:04.960
"Better luck next time."
At least we're consistent.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.960
I know!
THEY LAUGH

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
That is pretty high.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.960
I reckon that's beat.
I don't think that's beat.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.960
PHONE RINGS

16:34.960 --> 16:38.960
PHONE RINGS
ADAM: Do you wanna answer it?

16:38.960 --> 16:41.800
You answer it.
Hello?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.480
Hello, Michael?
Oh, hello.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.960
You won the challenge.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.480
Oi, oi,
we won the challenge, big boy.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.160
'Very good.'
Get in there! Thank you.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.960
You have some choices to make.
'Yes.'

16:50.960 --> 16:51.960
You can either...

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
..go and peek
in someone else's case.

16:54.960 --> 16:55.960
'Yeah.'

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
Or you can swap your case
with another pair.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.320
OK.
I will leave you to it.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.960
Cheers. Thanks, Stephen. Bye-bye.
'Cheers. Bye.'

17:06.960 --> 17:08.960
Fuck off! Who has done that?

17:08.960 --> 17:12.320
OK! OK!
Say what?! Say what?!

17:12.320 --> 17:13.960
Say what?
What?!

17:13.960 --> 17:16.640
Like, I have the right mind

17:16.640 --> 17:18.960
to put my fist straight through
the fucking bottom of it.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.960
Oh, it's defo just
Dan and Claire again.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.960
That's good now. So we've got that.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.960
We'll swap the case back
with Will and Jo-Anne. Yeah?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.960
So then we've rectified
the situation.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.960
Everyone's happy.
And then we still know

17:29.960 --> 17:31.960
that the case is gonna be
in their hands

17:31.960 --> 17:33.960
and Jae and Cherish have got
the Early Checkout.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
We wasn't expecting that money.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.960
Nah. And we were surprised
when we got it.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.960
So keeping it between the two of us

17:39.960 --> 17:41.960
with them hopefully getting
the money as well

17:41.960 --> 17:43.960
is definitely the right thing to do,
isn't it?

17:43.960 --> 17:47.960
We need to put our trust in them and
Will and Jo as they put trust in us.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.960
Yeah, definitely.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.960
If Adam and Michael haven't won,
there's something wrong.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.160
We're not hiring Adam to come
and do any building work for us.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.800
KNOCKING ON DOOR,
SHE GASPS

18:10.000 --> 18:12.960
SHE EXHALES
So there we go.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.960
Our word is our bond.
Shh.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.960
WHISPERING: Thank you.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.800
Thank you.
Yeah, cheers.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.800
I'd be a bit worried
if you didn't win that. Yeah.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.960
So, before...
Wait, which case is which?

18:25.960 --> 18:27.960
That's yours.
So we've all got eyes on that now.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.960
We basically wanna return
the favour, do you know what I mean?

18:29.960 --> 18:33.960
So hopefully,
in the challenge later on today,

18:33.960 --> 18:34.960
we can both be up there,

18:34.960 --> 18:36.960
and then you guys
get ten grand as well.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.960
Do you know what I mean? Team in.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.960
Let's go. Team, go, team! Right.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
We'll see you in a bit.
Be quiet. See you later.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.000
SHE CHUCKLES
We knew who were gonna win it.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.960
When it to came to us,
we were like, "Yes!"

19:01.480 --> 19:04.960
I am shattered. Stacking dominoes.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
Yeah, a bit of a nightmare,
wasn't it?

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
How did you guys do?

19:07.960 --> 19:11.000
Oh, we think it was the best
Room Service Challenge we've had.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.960
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.960
Did you guys win?
Um, we're not gonna say that.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.960
It was fun, though, wasn't it?

19:21.960 --> 19:25.960
'Our conversation with Cherish and
Jae definitely feels a bit tense.'

19:25.960 --> 19:29.960
Prior to the Room Service Challenge,

19:29.960 --> 19:31.640
we think that
the Early Checkout Card

19:31.640 --> 19:33.960
was with Cherish and Jae,

19:33.960 --> 19:36.960
which would fit with them being
a bit distant and a bit cold today.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.960
You guys a bit tired?
You seem a bit low on energy today.

19:39.960 --> 19:40.960
I'm tired today.
I'm tired.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.960
Mentally draining, that's all.
Yeah.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.320
It's mentally draining.
Physically, it's a lot as well.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.960
Soak up the view,
soak up the surroundings.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
We're in an incredible place.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.960
I don't like to sit
across the table from people

19:51.960 --> 19:54.160
who have literally just handed us
the death card.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.960
I just wanna put my hands
in the middle of the table and say,

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
"Right, let's just get to it."

19:59.960 --> 20:01.960
"What are you playing at?"
"What are you playing at?"

20:01.960 --> 20:05.960
"What was the reason?"
BOTH: "What was that reason?"

20:06.960 --> 20:08.960
So, no-one has an idea
where the money is.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.960
I ain't got... I ain't got a clue.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.960
Yeah?
I really ain't got a clue.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.960
I just sit there watching it.
Praying.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.960
What do we think about
the Early Checkout Card, then?

20:18.960 --> 20:19.960
Where do we think that is?

20:21.960 --> 20:25.960
I mean, asking us who we think has
the Early Checkout Card.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
How cheeky.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.480
Dunno. At this point it could be
anyone, and that's the funny thing.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.160
Yeah.
Could literally be anyone.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.960
Nobody's jumping up and down going,

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
"I've got
the Early Checkout Card here."

20:35.960 --> 20:38.960
Shut up, Dan.
Just close your mouths.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
Button it, OK?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.960
Hello there.
Hello, hello.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.960
You all right? You all right?
Hello.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.800
Right, it is time now
for your Day Trip Challenge.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.960
If I can ask you to prepare
for water activities.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
CHUCKLING

20:56.960 --> 21:00.960
Please don't go overboard.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.960
Your transport leaves shortly.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.960
Thank you.
Oh!

21:03.960 --> 21:06.960
You were hoping
for a bit more water.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.320
You love it, Jae.
Yeah.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.960
You can't get enough of the water.
# Don't go overboard... #

21:10.960 --> 21:12.960
You're half woman, half fish.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.960
# Don't go overboard... #
Not happy.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.960
# Don't go overboard. #
Cherish, I'm gonna knock you out.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.960
CHERISH LAUGHS

21:19.960 --> 21:22.960
Our alliance with Michael and Adam
is really strong,

21:22.960 --> 21:25.320
so all we need to do now
is win the challenge

21:25.320 --> 21:26.960
and make sure we keep that case.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
# It's about to go down

21:28.960 --> 21:31.960
# I'm gonna take it higher... #

21:31.960 --> 21:33.960
Hopefully, this is the one
that we're gonna win

21:33.960 --> 21:36.960
so that we can get Dan and Claire
out of the game.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.960
Let's get it on.
# Bring that fire

21:38.960 --> 21:40.960
# Oh, oh, oh, oh... #

21:40.960 --> 21:43.960
DAN: 'We love the challenges.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.480
'This is big stuff today,
and we've got to win.'

21:46.480 --> 21:48.160
# Fire, oh, oh, oh, oh

21:48.160 --> 21:50.160
# Oh, oh

21:50.160 --> 21:52.960
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh

21:52.960 --> 21:54.960
# Bring that fire. #

21:56.960 --> 21:59.960
It's important
that we do really well today.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.960
It's not our time to go.
It's not our time to go.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.960
And I'm hoping
that karma makes an appearance.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
THEY CHUCKLE

22:06.960 --> 22:07.960
If we keep winning challenges

22:07.960 --> 22:09.960
and we keep winning
Room Service Challenges,

22:09.960 --> 22:11.960
then we are, like,
so in control at the moment.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.960
I know.
We know everything. Like, people...

22:13.960 --> 22:15.960
The good thing about that
is no-one...

22:15.960 --> 22:17.960
no-one knows that we swapped cases.
I know. I know.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.960
Who do you think's
the Fortune Holders right now?

22:19.960 --> 22:23.480
We think maybe, erm,
Michael and Adam.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.960
Because we had suspicions
about Will and Jo initially.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.960
You know, we were thinking maybe
they're looking after their own.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.960
You know, they keep just
taking ten grand out each,

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
so everyone gets a...

22:31.960 --> 22:33.960
It's whether they've formed
some sort of...

22:33.960 --> 22:36.640
They have, they're always
with each other. ..alliance.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.800
Always with each other

22:37.800 --> 22:39.960
from breakfast, lunch, dinner,
always round each other.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.960
MUSIC: 'Another Way To Die'
by Alicia Keys and Jack White

23:01.320 --> 23:03.960
Is this Stephen coming in?
Oh, wow.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.960
AS BOND: Shaken, not stirred.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
Could we not have had
Daniel Craig doing this?

23:07.960 --> 23:10.960
Hi, guys.
ALL: Hi.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.640
Do you like my boat?
Yeah. It's nice.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.800
It's a bit like me.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.640
It's fast, it's sleek
and likes being tied up.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.960
THEY LAUGH

23:18.960 --> 23:22.960
The aim of today's
Day Trip Challenge is very simple.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.960
So, that over there is an island -
uh, we can see.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.960
It's called Hog Island.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.960
You have to go over
to that island

23:29.960 --> 23:33.960
and collect a cocktail
off a barman called Stephen.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.960
But I will only give you
that cocktail

23:36.960 --> 23:40.480
if you tell me the secret word.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.960
And that word
is an anagram of letters

23:43.960 --> 23:45.960
that are scattered all over the bay.

23:45.960 --> 23:50.960
The only way to get to
those letters is on a speedboat.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.800
The first team
to receive the cocktail

23:52.800 --> 23:55.960
will get that coveted
final swap tonight.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.960
And let's not forget, tonight,
another pair are going home,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.960
and another pair will be
in control of the fortune,

24:01.960 --> 24:04.960
pocketing £10,000 in the process.

24:04.960 --> 24:09.960
So, the first thing under here
are the keys of various boats.

24:09.960 --> 24:15.480
They are boats of differing quality,
so choose carefully.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.960
OK.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.160
Jo-Anne and Will,
what boat are you gonna go for?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.960
Jah Works.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.160
Jah Works, fantastic.
Take your key, please.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.960
Michael and Adam.
We're gonna go Sun Kist.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.960
Tommy and Scott.
Spitting Fire.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.960
Susan and Jen.
Blackbeard The Pirate.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.960
Aysha and Samm.
Bling.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.480
We're gonna go His Grace 2.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.960
You're not concerned about
what happened to His Grace 1?

24:42.960 --> 24:45.960
Little, a little.
Cherish and Jae got Unstoppable.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.960
You all right with that?
Yeah, it describes us.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.320
Perfect. I wish you good fortune.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
Off you go.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.960
Who's Jah Works?
Bling.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.960
What's this one?

25:05.960 --> 25:07.960
Yep. There's Bling.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.960
Blackbeard. Susan, in here,
Blackbeard. We're in here.

25:12.960 --> 25:16.960
Oh, no. Where is ours?
Where's ours?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.000
Go, boss.
Go, go, go!

25:19.000 --> 25:20.960
Let's go! Whoo!

25:20.960 --> 25:24.960
There's a little bit of rust
and a few little cracks.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.960
Oh, God.
The paint's peeling off, Will.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.960
Whoo. See you later, alligator.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.960
SCREAMING

25:34.960 --> 25:37.960
I like the bad boy.
It's not that. Look, Blade.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.960
Yeah, it's not this.
Oh, shit the bed.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.960
Whoo!

25:44.960 --> 25:47.960
Tommy and Scott are way gone.
Yeah.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.960
Well, we've got the slowest boat.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.960
D'you know what it reminds me of?

25:57.960 --> 25:59.960
We're good at anagrams.
I know.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.960
This is like me,
though, when I'm driving.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.160
Driving Miss Daisy.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.960
I don't think that's ours somehow?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.960
We're over there, aren't we?
Oh, we're not, are we?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.640
It's not that.
Please say it's not that.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.000
It's not looking good.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.320
It's a boat.
You need to find a boat.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.000
There is a boat.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.960
There is a boat?
Yeah.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.960
Is that? That can't be...
Fuck, that can't be the boat.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.960
Oh! Yeah, it is.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.960
Picked the wrong boat.
It'll be all right, won't it?

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
Yeah. A few buckets, and it'll
be ready to go. Got any oars?

26:46.960 --> 26:48.960
Unfortunately,

26:48.960 --> 26:51.960
it does mean you have come last
in this challenge.

26:51.960 --> 26:52.960
Oh, no.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.960
And you'll been making
the first swap this evening.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.960
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.800
Sun Kist. Sun Kist is an anagram...

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
Is it?
..of "it's sunk".

27:05.800 --> 27:07.960
Oh!
Why didn't you tell us that before?

27:07.960 --> 27:08.960
THEY LAUGH

27:11.960 --> 27:13.480
We are... We're gutted.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.160
I mean, you know,
we love doing the challenges,

27:15.160 --> 27:16.960
and to not even have a go

27:16.960 --> 27:18.960
and then being given
the automatic last place,

27:18.960 --> 27:22.160
seventh spot, is a is a bit
of a kick in the teeth, innit?

27:22.160 --> 27:24.960
But we always look on the bright
side of life no matter what,

27:24.960 --> 27:26.160
and we just try
and find the positives

27:26.160 --> 27:28.960
in not being able to go
on the challenge and being last.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.960
THEY LAUGH
Which isn't a lot.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.960
Left here, left here.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.960
Oh, there's one there,
left, left, left, left, left.

27:36.960 --> 27:40.960
Come on.
We need to be faster than this.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.800
There's one, there's one,
there's one.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.960
On the left,
the left behind the float.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.960
It's E.
I think we need to go this way.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.960
There's a gold one over there.
Right.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.960
Through this gap here, boss.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.960
D. E.
D. D. D for donkey.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.960
E-D. E-D.
E-D.

27:57.960 --> 27:58.960
There's one there.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.960
Where is there?
The back off this boat here, mate.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.960
E. M. Domino.
Domino. OK. To the bar.

28:05.960 --> 28:06.960
Go to the beach.
Go to the beach.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.960
This one first,
this one, this one, this one.

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
E-D-M. E-D-M.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.960
E-D-M. E-D-M.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.960
If this goes in with domino, then...
Yeah.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.960
R.
Oh, shit.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
No, it's not, it's not.
Oh, OK. Right. Hang on.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.960
So we've got M, R...
D-O-M-R-E.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.960
Drome. Room, Room end.
Room bed.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.960
Bedroom.
Bedroom.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.960
Go to the bar. The bar.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.480
The bar.
The bar. The bar.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.320
Oh, who's this? Are they coming in?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.960
Here comes Susan and Jen.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.960
Somebody's in.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.960
Do they have the right word, though?
That's the thing.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.960
Hope this is right. Hi, Stephen.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.960
OK, we think the word is bedroom.

28:52.960 --> 28:53.960
Bedroom.
Yeah.

28:55.960 --> 28:56.960
Is wrong.
Oh, no. Oh, fuck.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.960
Go on, then. Keep going.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.960
Keep going.
Wrong fucking word.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.960
Claire, here's one. A. A.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
So with all these letters we got,
we should get it.

29:11.960 --> 29:12.960
D-R-E-A-M.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.960
We mustn't keep saying it
in the same order.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.960
We've got five.
We need two more. Yeah.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.960
It could be "dreamer".

29:18.960 --> 29:20.960
It's M again.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
Two Ms.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.960
E-D-M-R. There, there!
Look, they've got a cocktail.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.960
Come on, Will and Jo-Anne.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.960
Now there, please.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.480
Don't point too obviously.
Yeah.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.800
Oh, there's one here.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.960
Is that I? I. I.
I.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.960
We've got all of them. OK.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.960
E-D-M-M-R-A-I.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.960
CHERISH: 'We have to win.'

29:42.960 --> 29:44.960
We actually have to win,
and the stakes are high.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.960
Mr...

29:48.960 --> 29:51.160
Come on, Will and Jo-Anne.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.960
Madame. M-A-D-A-M-E. Madame.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.960
Do you want to try it,
shall we just try it?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.960
It ain't got an R,
it ain't got an R in it.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.960
Oh, we haven't got an R.
Got an R, got an R. Murder.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.960
Because it could also be maid.
Something maid.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.960
Mermaid?

30:08.960 --> 30:11.960
M-E-R-A-I-D.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.800
But we didn't see a D.
Yes, we did.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.960
We did! The E, D.
Oh, yeah.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
Can we go to the island?
Can we go to the island?

30:22.960 --> 30:25.960
Mermaid. Mermaid, mermaid.
Oh, my God.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.000
Can we pull up to the beach?

30:28.000 --> 30:32.960
Mermaid. To the beach, please.
To the beach.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.960
Let's go. Oh.
Cherish and Jae.

30:41.960 --> 30:42.960
Welcome to my bar.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.480
Hi. Hello.
Hi, Steven.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.800
What have you got for me?
Mermaid. Mermaid?

30:48.960 --> 30:50.960
Congratulations.
SCREAMING

30:50.960 --> 30:54.480
# Unstoppable today

30:54.480 --> 30:56.000
# Unstoppable today... #

30:56.000 --> 30:57.960
You get the final slot tonight.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.640
Oh, my God.
Where's my cocktail?

31:00.640 --> 31:02.960
Girls, you've destroyed my bar.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.480
SCREAMING

31:05.960 --> 31:08.960
SONG: 'Under The Sea'

31:08.960 --> 31:10.960
You came first.
So sorry.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
So sorry.
It's all right.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.960
Scott and Tommy are coming in.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.960
The word is mermaid, right?
Are you sure?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.960
I think so.
It's right.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.160
Come on.
Gents.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.960
Yes, where's my drink?
Yes. Number two.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.960
Merm. We haven't got a U.
Mermaid.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
Mermaid. Mermaid, mermaid.
In, in, in, please.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.960
OK. Dan and Claire,
have they done it?

31:31.960 --> 31:34.960
Mermaid.
Mermaid...

31:34.960 --> 31:35.960
is right.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
Woo-hoo.
Here you go.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.320
Number three.
Got it. Got it.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.640
Mermaid.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.960
Mermaid?
Mermaid.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.960
Is right.
Get in!

31:43.960 --> 31:47.960
Yes!
Here, Jo-Anne. Number four.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.960
Cheers. Well done.
Take that.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.960
Well done, guys.
Well done.

31:52.960 --> 31:56.960
M-O-O-R-I-D-B.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.800
Have we got two Os?
Two Os. Right.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.000
What kind of a cocktail is this?

32:03.000 --> 32:07.960
I have a feeling it's rum something.
What is it? Mud rum?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.960
Let's go and say mud.
Maid rum.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.960
Huh?
Maid rum.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
Maid rum. OK. Let's go.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.960
We're last. We're last.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.960
Susan, chill,
if we're last, we're last.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.960
Look, let's go in,
we've got the letters. Yeah.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.960
And even if we need to sit there
and keep thinking it through.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.960
You never know.
Somebody might help us out.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.960
OK.
Right, can we just go in, please?

32:30.960 --> 32:33.960
You got a word for me?
Maid rum.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.960
Say it again.
Maid rum.

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
Come on, girls.
It's not over yet.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.800
Come on, girls.
Write it in the sand.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.960
Work it out. Take your time.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.960
Just take your time.
Just try and work it out.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.320
Keep writing them all out.
Right. So we've got "bride".

32:49.320 --> 32:52.960
WHISPERS: B? They have a B?

32:52.960 --> 32:55.960
Double check the letters.
Make sure they're all perfect.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.960
Let's go back, then. Come.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.960
Do you want to go back out?

33:01.960 --> 33:03.960
To do what?
To go back to them again.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.480
If I go back out,
I'm not coming back.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.960
We are coming back in.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
When they were reading
the letters out, she read,

33:09.960 --> 33:12.960
B-O-O, all sorts.

33:12.960 --> 33:16.960
Don't have the energy.
Thank you. Susan!

33:16.960 --> 33:18.960
Just give me a fucking minute,
sorry. OK.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.960
Everyone's looking.
Just get me in the boat, please.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.960
That's an I. Is that an I?
Yeah.

33:31.960 --> 33:32.960
Let's go, let's go back.
OK, go back.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.960
M again.
Another M.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
Another M.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.960
So we got that wrong. Two Ms.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.960
I'm thinking "dime". And we need
to start writing with the sand.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
There's an R.
Have we seen a B?

33:44.960 --> 33:47.960
Where did we get a B from then?
Dime rum.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.960
Um, there's no, um. There's no U.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.480
Mermaid.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.160
Back to the bar, boss.
Back to the bar.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.800
If this isn't it...

34:04.800 --> 34:06.000
Go on.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.960
Mermaid.
Is the word mermaid?

34:09.960 --> 34:11.800
It's mermaid.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
We got it.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.160
You've got it. Well done.
Well done, guys.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.960
Aysha and Samm, it's all over,
I'm afraid. Come on up.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.960
WHOOPING

34:23.960 --> 34:26.960
Listen, I've got some good news
and bad news.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.960
OK.
You didn't come last.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.960
Is it?

34:29.960 --> 34:32.960
You are in sixth place,
but it's not last.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.960
What's the cocktail?
Well, it's just a word.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Mermaid.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.960
Mermaid.
Are you for real?

34:39.800 --> 34:41.960
I was thinking way out of the box.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.960
Well done, guys.
APPLAUSE

34:44.960 --> 34:48.960
SOBBING: I'm so tired.
It's OK. Don't cry.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.960
SOBS

34:50.960 --> 34:51.960
It's all right.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.960
Well done. Anagrams on boats.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.000
Who knew it'd be so dramatic?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.960
Yeah, I'm never watching
The Little Mermaid ever again

35:02.960 --> 35:04.960
without throwing something
at the TV.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.960
Michael and Adam, so you are
in that last position tonight.

35:08.960 --> 35:09.960
How are you feeling about that?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
I think we're just hoping
for a bit of luck

35:11.960 --> 35:13.160
in the Lady Luck, to be honest.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.960
It's not a nice place to be,
but it is what it is, innit?

35:15.960 --> 35:16.960
It's all luck.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.960
I'm really worried
about Michael and Adam.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.960
WILL: 'That could not have gone
much worse.'

35:22.960 --> 35:26.960
Our winners this afternoon,
Cherish and Jae.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.960
Unstoppable,
like the name of your boat.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.960
Yeah! We came first!
We came first!

35:31.960 --> 35:33.960
How are you feeling?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.480
Really, really good, Stephen.
Amazing.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.320
We started the day
with the Early Checkout Card,

35:39.320 --> 35:41.960
and now we have the power.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.960
Wow, wow, wow.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.960
To give it to anybody we like.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
GROANS

36:05.960 --> 36:08.960
Sorry. I'm infuriated
at myself for overthinking,

36:08.960 --> 36:14.960
and I'm embarrassed by it as well,
to be honest.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.960
ALL CHANT: Top two van! Top two van!

36:16.960 --> 36:21.960
ALL: Top two van! Whoo!
CHEERING

36:21.960 --> 36:24.960
Well done, guys, honestly.
Well done, guys.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.960
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you lot.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
Just when you think that, yeah,
we're playing the game,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.800
we're doing all right and then...

36:31.800 --> 36:33.960
But you literally have
no control at all. No.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.480
Who'd you reckon Cherish and Jae
will give the card to?

36:36.480 --> 36:37.960
Hopefully not us.

36:37.960 --> 36:38.960
I mean,
this is the name of the game,

36:38.960 --> 36:40.960
like, obviously,
Jae and Cherish have won,

36:40.960 --> 36:42.960
and that's the worst case.

36:42.960 --> 36:43.960
'That's worst-case scenario.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.960
'It's gonna be interesting to see
what happens going into tonight.'

36:47.960 --> 36:50.160
I'm feeling a little bit worried,
actually.

36:50.160 --> 36:55.960
If Jae and Cherish have got the
Early Checkout Card, they are smart.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.800
They're gonna be looking
for the money,

36:58.800 --> 37:00.960
and it's pretty plain
that we don't have the money,

37:00.960 --> 37:01.960
they won't look to take...

37:01.960 --> 37:05.960
I think they're gonna look and try
and lock in that £10,000 tonight.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.960
So maybe we should look to swap.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.960
We need to think
where do they think the money is

37:09.960 --> 37:11.480
and make sure
we've not got that case.

37:21.960 --> 37:26.960
Argh! Back to the hotel.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.000
WILL: So we've come fourth.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.960
Obviously, Jae and Cherish hold
the Early Checkout Card.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.960
Essentially,
they've got the last pick,

37:32.960 --> 37:34.960
and they're sending someone home
inevitably.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.320
Can you imagine
how they must be feeling?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.000
We're number one. Number one.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.960
Number one. Number one.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.960
I think we just keep hold on
to our case,

37:43.960 --> 37:45.960
and hopefully, no-one swaps with us

37:45.960 --> 37:48.960
because I do want that ten grand
now, really, to be fair.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.320
Do you?
Yeah.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.960
You're going tonight.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.960
You're going tonight?
Yeah.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
It was never ours to begin with.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.800
It was never... I told you
I didn't see it. I ain't seen it.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.960
Cherish, what are we doing?

38:00.960 --> 38:03.800
We need the money
in our hands tonight.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.960
Well, we know where that is.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.960
There's no mercy because, at some
point, it could come right back.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.800
Back to us, yeah.
So we know what we need to do.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.960
But let's not overthink it.
Yeah.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.960
Let's go get ready for Lady Luck.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.960
# Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Kiki, gee-gee

38:21.960 --> 38:24.960
# Lady Luck
Kiki, gee-gee, Lady Luck. #

38:28.960 --> 38:32.000
# Soldier, hold your line

38:32.000 --> 38:35.160
# Light 'em up
Now it's time to fight... #

38:35.160 --> 38:37.960
'I feel like we are in a
vulnerable position at the moment.'

38:37.960 --> 38:40.960
'Yeah, because we've come last
in the challenge earlier today.'

38:40.960 --> 38:41.960
I'm nervous.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.960
# To pay the price of war... #

38:47.960 --> 38:49.960
DANIEL:
'It's dangerous for us tonight.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.800
'We've got people
who are gonna be making selections

38:52.800 --> 38:54.960
'in the Lady Luck Bar after us.'

38:54.960 --> 38:56.960
So, erm, I'm really worried.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.960
# Rise up
Everybody take a stand... #

39:00.960 --> 39:03.960
CHERISH: 'Tonight for us
is all about revenge

39:03.960 --> 39:05.960
'and getting a hold of that money.'

39:07.960 --> 39:09.960
WILL: 'Tonight, that money is ours.'

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
JO-ANNE: 'We don't want anybody
to take our case.'

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
Good evening.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.960
ALL: Good evening.
Good evening, all.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.480
So, the Nightcap.

39:24.480 --> 39:29.480
Cherish and Jae, you are in
the supremely comfortable position

39:29.480 --> 39:31.960
of being able to sit back,

39:31.960 --> 39:35.480
listen to what everyone else says,
watch how the cases move,

39:35.480 --> 39:38.960
and then at the end,
come in and make your move.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.960
You must be feeling pretty good.
Yeah.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.960
Dan and Claire, you came third
in the challenge today.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.960
That's, up till now,
been a pretty safe spot to be in.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.960
Are you feeling relaxed?
No.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.960
This is the first time
we've come into a Lady Luck Bar

39:54.960 --> 39:57.960
without knowing that we're gonna
be able to come out of it unscathed.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.960
Um, so it's, um,
incredibly stressful and unnerving.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.960
You have an idea of what everyone
else has been going through.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.960
Yeah, yeah, it's an
unpleasant situation to be in.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.960
So, before we get to the swaps,
as always,

40:11.960 --> 40:14.640
I'd like to hear if there's anything
you'd like to say.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.960
This is your chance to try and flush
out who the Fortune Holders are...

40:19.960 --> 40:23.320
..or your last chance to find out

40:23.320 --> 40:25.960
who the Early Checkout
Cardholders are.

40:27.960 --> 40:28.960
Jo-Anne and Will.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.960
I just want to say good luck
to everybody.

40:32.960 --> 40:37.960
Um, we're all doing our utmost best,
and I just want to, erm...

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
Oh.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
Just thank everybody...

40:45.960 --> 40:49.960
..for helping me live my best life
for the minute.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
Thank you, Jo-Anne.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.960
The whole thing of us being here
in the Fortune Hotel,

40:55.960 --> 40:58.960
it's changed my life.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.960
I just don't want it to end.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.480
You all have to decide now

41:03.480 --> 41:05.480
whether you're gonna stick
with what you've got,

41:05.480 --> 41:07.320
or whether you're gonna swap.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.960
Remember, whoever finishes tonight
with the fortune...

41:11.640 --> 41:13.960
..gets to pull £10,000 from it

41:13.960 --> 41:16.960
and gets to decide where
the Early Checkout Card goes next.

41:16.960 --> 41:20.000
It's all to play for.
Michael and Adam.

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
You came last today.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.960
You will be making
that first move,

41:24.960 --> 41:28.480
and because you came last,
you will have to swap.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.960
So who are you gonna swap with
and why?

41:30.960 --> 41:33.480
Um, we'd like to swap with, today,
Tommy and Scott.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.480
Um, the reason being is we started
with that case last night,

41:37.480 --> 41:39.800
and we said from day dot,
there was nothing in it.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.000
We've now got nothing in this case.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.160
So, hopefully, we're gonna gain
a bit of trust this way,

41:44.160 --> 41:46.960
and really,
that's what we're gonna do.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.960
OK. Please swap.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.960
WHISPERS: Cheers, mate.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.960
Aysha and Samm.
What are you gonna do?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.960
I think we'll stick.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.960
OK. Thank you. Susan and Jen.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.960
What are you thinking,
swap or stick?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.800
We're just going to stick
with our case.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.960
Jo-Anne and Will, you're next up.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.640
You can stick. You can swap.
What's the thinking?

42:17.640 --> 42:21.320
Um, we've chatted about it,
and yesterday, in the Lady Luck Bar,

42:21.320 --> 42:23.960
we felt like
we had a bit of an inkling

42:23.960 --> 42:26.000
about where
the Early Checkout Card was.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Tonight,
we really haven't got a clue.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.960
And to us, staying here
is worth more than ten grand.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.960
So we're gonna stick
because we know we're safe.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
Fingers crossed people won't think
we've got the money.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.960
All we need to do now is just
keep it till the end of the swaps.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.960
Just got to keep it.

42:43.960 --> 42:46.960
Daniel and Claire, next up.
What's the plan?

42:48.960 --> 42:49.960
We'd like to swap with...

42:55.960 --> 42:57.160
..Will and Jo-Anne.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.960
'Holy shit. What's happening?'

43:00.960 --> 43:05.960
The reason being, we feel that
it's likely to be a safe swap.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.640
JAE: 'What's going on right now?'

43:07.640 --> 43:10.480
CHERISH: 'If you have the money,
why are you swapping?'

43:10.480 --> 43:13.960
We're in a trickier spot tonight,

43:13.960 --> 43:15.960
but we're still keen
to keep on learning,

43:15.960 --> 43:17.960
and this is a way of going about it.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.960
OK. Please swap.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.960
We did that, really,
to try and create a distraction.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.960
I feel a bit sick, to be honest.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.960
So there are two pairs left.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.960
We've had two swaps
and three sticks.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.960
Tommy and Scott, you're up next.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.000
You've seen
what everyone else has done.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.960
What do you think.
We think we're gonna keep.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.640
OK. Thank you.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.960
Cherish, Jae.

43:55.960 --> 44:01.640
So here you are in that position
everyone wants to be in.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.960
The final move of this evening
is down to the two of you.

44:05.480 --> 44:06.960
What are you gonna do?

44:10.960 --> 44:12.480
So...
CLEARS THROAT

44:15.320 --> 44:16.960
It's been a very, um...

44:18.320 --> 44:23.480
..tumultuous last 24 hours for us.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.960
Um... We've had highs.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.960
Obviously, today was absolutely
amazing, winning the challenge.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.960
We were actually given
the Early Checkout Card.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
OK.

44:39.960 --> 44:43.320
And this is a very powerful position
to be put in.

44:43.320 --> 44:45.960
'I wanted to get rid
of Dan and Claire,

44:45.960 --> 44:48.800
'and take the money
from them at the same time.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.960
'But now they've swapped
with Will and Jo.'

44:50.960 --> 44:53.960
'Do we chase the money
with Will and Jo?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.640
'Or do we stick
with getting Dan and Claire out?'

44:59.960 --> 45:04.960
The couple that we have decided
to swap with tonight is...

45:11.960 --> 45:13.160
..Dan and Claire.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.960
We're gonna look like
a pair of evil baddies.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
The trust has gone.

45:31.960 --> 45:35.960
Wow, Will and Jo!
I'm sorry, you're now my enemy.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.960
Once that trust is broken with us,
it is done, innit?

45:38.960 --> 45:40.960
Your challenge starts now.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.640
'What were you saying?'
I'm listening.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.960
You're not telling me anything.

45:44.960 --> 45:48.800
'I honestly can't wait to put
Michael and Adam out.' Come on!

45:48.800 --> 45:50.960
You need to wait
to see your opponent's move

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
before you make your move.

45:51.960 --> 45:55.960
It's two couples playing against
each and every couple here.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
Would you be prepared
to get rid of Jae and Cherish?

45:57.960 --> 45:58.960
Yeah.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.960
Michael and Adam,
we want them to give their case

46:03.960 --> 46:06.000
to Jae and Cherish
so we can take Jae and Cherish out.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.960
We have never used our alliance
to manipulate another couple.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.480
So there is an alliance?
Absolutely, there is.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.960
We didn't want this case.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.160
Can we get this moving?
We've got other swaps to make.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.800
Let's find out
who won the Fortune Hotel.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
