WEBVTT

00:04.960 --> 00:06.960
Welcome to the Caribbean.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.960
Ten pairs of guests
have travelled here from the UK

00:09.960 --> 00:12.960
and are about to check in
to a unique hotel.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.960
Now, this might look like the
perfect spot to relax and unwind.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.960
But they shouldn't get
too comfortable,

00:17.960 --> 00:20.960
as these holiday-makers are here
to play a devious game.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.640
A quarter-of-a-million pounds
is up for grabs.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.960
All they have to do is find
and keep hold of the Fortune Case.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.960
However, our guests should beware.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.960
Hidden in another case
is the dreaded Early Checkout Card.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
The couple that ends each day
with that case

00:38.960 --> 00:41.960
will be packing their bags
and leaving the hotel for good.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.960
There'll be epic challenges...
Whoo!

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, you idiot!

00:44.960 --> 00:46.960
What are you doing?
SHOUTING

00:46.960 --> 00:49.960
..intense investigations...
So, who's got the money?

00:49.960 --> 00:51.960
I know what's there,
and I don't trust that guy.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.640
..and thrilling case swaps.
That's my opinion.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.960
You need to keep your opinions
to yourself.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.960
It's time for sun, sand and secrets

00:59.960 --> 01:01.960
at The Fortune Hotel.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.960
Look at all of this, mate.
It's a different world.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
Oh, mate.
This is what we're about, big man.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.960
Beats being at home, digging holes,
laying bricks.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.960
THEY LAUGH

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
Hi, I'm Adam, and I'm a bricklayer.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm a landscaper.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.480
We're best friends,
and we are from...

01:29.480 --> 01:30.960
BOTH: Bognor Regis.

01:33.960 --> 01:34.960
Looks nice, don't it?

01:34.960 --> 01:37.960
Our relationship is fun,
cheeky chaps,

01:37.960 --> 01:39.960
and we light up the room,
my friend, don't we?

01:39.960 --> 01:40.960
'That's what we think, anyway.'

01:40.960 --> 01:42.960
You look pretty, Mike.
MIKE LAUGHS

01:43.960 --> 01:45.640
Oh, my days.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.960
Tell you what, mate. Look at that.
ADAM LAUGHS

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
A little bit special,
that is, innit?

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
That is absolutely unreal.
That is a bit special.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.640
Our strategy is basically
to be the fun guys,

01:55.640 --> 01:57.960
to befriend everyone
so they want us around.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.960
If we find a pairing

01:59.960 --> 02:01.960
and maybe link together
for a little bit... Yeah.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.800
Just see what we can get going,

02:03.800 --> 02:05.960
and if we can ride that wave
for a bit, and at the right time,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.320
we start cutting down trees,
then we need to, don't we? Bye-bye.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.640
Yeah. Oh, I like it.
Hoo!

02:10.640 --> 02:13.960
Game face now, innit? Game face.
Straight in, mate.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.960
Let's go for it.
You ready?

02:15.960 --> 02:17.960
Oh, my God! Look at it. D'you reckon
we're here? Look at that.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.960
'It's not like
when we go to Mallorca, is it?'

02:19.960 --> 02:21.960
MUSIC: 'Take Your Mama'
by Scissor Sisters

02:21.960 --> 02:24.960
# Take your mama out all night... #

02:24.960 --> 02:28.960
At The Fortune Hotel, I'm just
not gonna trust anyone at all,

02:28.960 --> 02:30.480
cos I've came to win
that prize money.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.960
'So, 100% in it to win it.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.'

02:33.960 --> 02:35.960
We're gonna win it, aren't we?
Yep, we are. Mm.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.960
Cheers.
Cheers.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.960
All right, fellas?
Hi, guys. Welcome.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.960
Wow. What a gaff.
It's unbelievable, innit?

02:42.960 --> 02:45.960
It's just like a dream, isn't it?
I know, mate, look at it.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
She's my mum. My best mate as well.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.960
Oh, that's lovely.
Same person, really.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.960
Is he...? Is he a good boy?

02:51.960 --> 02:53.000
He is, yeah.
I am now, yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.960
Yeah, I am proud of him. I am, yeah.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.960
Oh, hello.
Hello, you all right?

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello, you all right?

03:02.960 --> 03:04.480
How are we doing?
Oh, my God.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.960
So, you two are a couple,
I'm guessing?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.160
Yeah. Yeah.
Not brother and sister, no?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.960
No, we're... 16 years, is it,
or 17 years? 16 years.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
Married 16 years?

03:11.960 --> 03:14.480
No, not married.
Oh, you're not married, no? Ah.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.960
Our strategy is basically

03:16.960 --> 03:20.480
to trust no-one
and question everything.

03:20.480 --> 03:23.800
And needing a nice slice of luck.
Yes.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.960
Thank you.
I think our competition's here.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
BOTH: Hi!
You all right? Welcome.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.960
How are you?
Very good. You all right?

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
So nice to meet you guys.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.960
My name is Jae.
My name's Cherish.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.960
So, how do you guys know each other?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
We're best friends.
Yeah.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.320
The way I would
describe our friendship is,

03:43.320 --> 03:47.160
I am the calm,
and she is the storm.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.960
Uh... Yeah.
Yeah.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.960
So, who would you say is the boss
out the two of you?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.960
Who do you reckon?
I let her take the...

03:52.960 --> 03:54.640
You "let" me?
I let her.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.960
LAUGHTER

03:58.320 --> 04:00.960
This is incredible.
Look at this, man. Ayy!

04:00.960 --> 04:02.960
Hi, fellas.
Hi.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.000
Hiya.
How are we? Nice to meet you all.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.960
I'm Tommy.
I'm Scott.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
What do you boys do?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.640
He's a barber, and I'm in uni, so...
Ah, nice.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.960
I'm actually a hair stylist.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.320
Did you style his?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.960
TOMMY LAUGHS
Got any gameplay?

04:16.960 --> 04:19.960
Yeah, you've gotta come here with
a plan and have some idea, but...

04:19.960 --> 04:21.960
not gonna tell you that. Oh!
You've came here with a plan, then?

04:21.960 --> 04:24.800
No, no, not in the slightest.
Cat's out the bag.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.960
The cat's out the bag.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.320
The game plan was to convince
everyone we had a game plan

04:28.320 --> 04:30.960
so that they were scared,
because we don't have a game plan.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.960
But we're here to win,
at the end of the day.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.960
So, what type of characters
do you think we need to be wary of?

04:34.960 --> 04:37.960
You don't need to worry
about us two. That's all you need...

04:37.960 --> 04:39.960
Oh, that makes me worry, though.
That makes us...

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
That makes me worry.
Yeah.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.800
Hi.
How are you?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.960
Wow.
Thank you.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.960
I think we have to just be wary
of the type of jobs

04:47.960 --> 04:49.960
that somebody may do as well.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.960
Hello.
Ahh.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
I'm Claire.
Nice to meet you, I'm Dan. Hi.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.960
Hi, Dan. Nice to meet you.
So, what do you guys do?

04:58.960 --> 05:00.960
So, I work in hospitality.
Nice.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
I'm a barrister.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.640
Barrister? Oh, really?
Oh, wow.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.960
One to watch out for.
You don't need the money, then.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
You're all right.
LAUGHTER

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
Nice try.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.960
I'm Dan. I'm Claire,
and we're a married couple.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
So, have we met
our first serious players, then?

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
I'm sure we're all serious players.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.960
I don't think you'd be here
if you weren't. Not really.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.320
I'm a criminal barrister,

05:23.320 --> 05:25.640
and I have been
for the last 20 years.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.960
I hope this game's gonna involve
a lot of bluffing and manipulating.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.960
'That will play
to some of my strengths.'

05:32.960 --> 05:36.960
And my family business
is a hotel in Gloucestershire,

05:36.960 --> 05:41.960
so I guess both of us, our strength
is kind of understanding people.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
What do you guys
do for a living, then?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
I'm in construction.
Carpentry, yeah.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
Mum.
Very nice.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.960
Three kids.
How many? Three children?

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Yeah.
Wow!

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
I'm Aysha.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.960
You're actually Samm.
THEY LAUGH

05:55.960 --> 05:57.960
# Just the two of us... #

05:57.960 --> 06:00.960
This, for us, is...
It's like a honeymoon, right?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
It's our chance. An adventure.
Yeah, so excited.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.960
You've gotta win
the competition, then,

06:04.960 --> 06:06.960
just to stay away
from the children long enough.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.960
THEY LAUGH
That's the plan.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.960
If we were to win this game... Ah.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.640
Huge accomplishment.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.960
And I feel it would really
make our girls proud.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
Yeah. Would change our lives.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.960
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! The Fortune Hotel!

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Oh, my God!

06:25.960 --> 06:29.480
Oh, my God, Susan, we're here.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.640
Hi, I'm Jen, I'm an administrator
for the Scottish Government.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.960
Hi, I'm Susan,
and I'm a criminal investigator.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.960
When we introduce ourselves,

06:38.960 --> 06:41.800
I might drop
some absolute red herrings

06:41.800 --> 06:45.960
and put people off the scent
without giving away my area of work.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.960
The minute you tell somebody
you're an investigator,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
they're cautious
about what they say around you.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.960
So I'm going to say something
completely opposite,

06:53.960 --> 06:56.960
make them feel relaxed around me,
open up.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.960
What do you guys do?
I'm an HR administrator.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
OK.
Yeah.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
My parents own a fish farm, so...
Wow.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
Yeah.
Salmon?

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
Er, rainbow trout.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.960
The ultimate goal here
is to win £250,000,

07:10.960 --> 07:14.960
so I wouldn't want
to come up against a couple

07:14.960 --> 07:17.960
who came from police
or legal background.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.960
And what do you guys do?

07:19.960 --> 07:22.800
I'm a lawyer.
Nice. Fab.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.640
Louie, what the hell?
HE GASPS

07:27.640 --> 07:28.960
Oh, my God, stunning.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
Hi, you OK?
Hi.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.000
How are you doing?
I'm good, thank you.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.960
How are you?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.960
So, I'm Louie.
I'm Chloe.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
Are you friends?
Yes.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.480
Yes, best friends. Best friends.
Best friends?

07:39.480 --> 07:42.000
BOTH: Business partners as well.
Oh, wow.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
I'm the queen of aesthetics.
And I'm the king of skin.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.480
You're the king of...?
Skin.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.960
First impressions will be
that we are underestimated.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.960
The beauty industry, they think
it's like ditzy people. Yeah.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.160
LAUGHTER
'It's like a stereotype.'

07:54.160 --> 07:55.960
Yeah, 1,000%.
And we just don't fit it.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.960
And have you guys been
to the Caribbean before?

07:57.960 --> 07:59.320
No. No.
No?

07:59.320 --> 08:00.960
I've been to
the Dominican Republic.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
Ah. How was it?
Oh, is that the Caribbean?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.640
Yeah. Yeah.
I have been to the Caribbean before.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.960
LAUGHTER

08:07.960 --> 08:10.000
Chloe and Louie.
Chloe and Louie.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
'Erm... I hope she doesn't try
to persuade me to get Botox.'

08:15.000 --> 08:19.960
I think they're very, very loud,
and they're very, very in-your-face.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.960
Back to the game now,
this is what we're talking about.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.960
Have youse two any game plans?
This is what we wanna know.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.960
I think the main thing is enjoy it.
Yeah.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.160
Do you know... But, like, obviously,
we are here to win.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.960
We're here to win.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.960
MUSIC: 'Holiday'
by Madonna

08:35.960 --> 08:38.960
You would fight to win the 250,000
with me, wouldn't you?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.480
I know I would.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.320
I think we'll be good contenders
because people would think,

08:43.320 --> 08:46.960
"Oh, dipsy, fun, giggly."

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
But, no, we will...

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
I think we've got this.
Yeah.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
TRACEY SQUEALS

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
Oh, I'm loving your energy.
Youse are literally...

08:54.960 --> 08:56.800
I'm just so excited to see you all.
Good.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.960
So, what's your names?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
I'm Susan.
Susan.

08:59.960 --> 09:00.960
I'm Jen.
Jane.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.960
Jen.
Jane.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.960
Jen.
Gin? Gin.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.960
Jennifer, but short.
Oh, Jen!

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
Yeah.
Jen!

09:09.960 --> 09:11.960
LAUGHTER

09:11.960 --> 09:14.960
Sorry, Jen.
That's OK, that's OK.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.960
I'm Tracey, Mama Tracey to Abbie,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
from Cardiff.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
You're not from Cardiff,
you're from the Valleys,

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
but you live in Cardiff.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.000
Have youse two had a few drinks
before you've come here?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.960
LAUGHTER

09:25.960 --> 09:28.960
We don't have a typical mother
and daughter relationship. Mm, no.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
A lot of parents would feel
disrespected if their child called,

09:30.960 --> 09:33.960
like, their parent
by their first name,

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
and I call you Trace.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.160
So, in your pairing,
is there a boss?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.960
Abbie likes to think she's the boss,

09:38.960 --> 09:41.960
but I think
she should listen to me more.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
But I do keep her on track
a few times, you know? So...

09:43.960 --> 09:46.960
TRACEY WHISPERS
Yeah.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.320
Abbie's got the intelligence
and intuition.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.960
I have taken acting classes,

09:51.960 --> 09:54.960
so I can kind of understand
people's behaviour a bit better.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.960
So, I think we should all have
a cheers to us all, and good luck.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.960
Yep.
Yeah? May the best group win.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.960
ALL: Cheers.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
TRACEY: Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

10:03.960 --> 10:06.000
Game on.
LAUGHTER

10:17.960 --> 10:19.480
Hello.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Hello.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.960
Hello.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
Look where we are.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.640
Isn't it awful?
LAUGHTER

10:29.640 --> 10:32.480
Now, welcome to The Fortune Hotel.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.960
We are delighted to have you here.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.160
As you may have already guessed,

10:36.160 --> 10:39.960
this is not going to be
your average holiday.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.640
At the end of this holiday,
two of you could be heading home

10:43.640 --> 10:47.000
with a quarter-of-a-million pounds
in cash.

10:48.960 --> 10:49.960
'Obviously, we're gonna win.'

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
Tell them again.
We're gonna win.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
Tell them again.
WHISPERS: We're gonna win.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.960
But before we have winners
and losers,

10:56.960 --> 10:58.800
we have to play the game.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.960
And the game is very simple.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.000
Find the money and keep hold of it.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
In a minute, I'm gonna ask you all
to select a room key.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.960
In each room, there is a briefcase.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.960
One of those cases is full of money.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
If you're lucky enough
to find the £250,000 case,

11:16.960 --> 11:22.320
then congratulations,
you are the Fortune Holders.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.960
Eight of those cases are worthless.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.960
If you find one of those,
you are the Fortune Hunters.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.960
The remaining case contains
the potentially fatal

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
Early Checkout Card.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.960
Holding this
makes you the Unfortunates,

11:39.960 --> 11:44.960
and you are in serious danger
of leaving The Fortune Hotel.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.800
But don't worry, every day,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.960
there will be an opportunity
to swap cases,

11:48.960 --> 11:52.960
as you compete in daily challenges
in the hotel and across the island.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.640
The challenges is what
I'm looking forward to the most,

11:55.640 --> 11:57.960
just because of the sheer fact
that we are so competitive,

11:57.960 --> 11:59.960
and we don't lose.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.960
Before you ask,
all the cases are identical.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.960
They look the same, they feel
the same, they weigh the same.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.960
It's not the cases you need
to keep an eye on, it's the people.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.800
The only way to win the money
is to know where it is,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.960
and the best way to do that
is to play the game well.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.960
And most importantly of all,
perhaps, be lucky.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.960
Fortune favours the brave.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.960
Right, it's time to start the game.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.960
Clarista, would you mind
offering our guests the keys?

12:29.960 --> 12:32.960
Choose wisely, everyone.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.960
Your fate lies inside your case.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.640
Will we just go for
lucky number seven? Yeah.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.960
We await to see what's in that case.
Yep.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.960
You know, I just thought
one was a good one to go for

12:47.960 --> 12:48.960
cos that's first place, isn't it?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
And that's where we'd like to be.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
Huh.
What do you reckon?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.480
LAUGHTER
Take your pick.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.960
We'll have this one.
Yeah, thanks. Lovely.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.160
Thank you, Clarista.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.960
It's time for the moment of truth.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.960
Off you go, find your rooms,

13:04.960 --> 13:08.960
and don't let those cases
out of your sight.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.160
Good luck, everyone.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.960
SONG: 'Money, Money, Money'
by Christian Reindl feat Lloren

13:13.960 --> 13:17.960
# Always sunny

13:17.960 --> 13:20.640
# In a rich man's...

13:22.480 --> 13:23.960
# World... #

13:29.640 --> 13:30.960
I think if we open the briefcase,

13:30.960 --> 13:32.960
and we had the Early Checkout,
pressure's on.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.640
It's like we need
to put our money where our mouth is.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.000
If we open the briefcase
and it's empty - game on.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.480
I'm normally lucky. So if we find
a quarter-of-a-million pounds

13:45.480 --> 13:48.640
in our briefcase, we are taking that
to the nearest airport

13:48.640 --> 13:49.960
and getting straight out of here.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.960
If there's 250 grand in there,
I'll be like that.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.480
Shh!
SHE LAUGHS

13:55.480 --> 13:58.320
I'm gonna jump on that bed, though,
I'll be jumping on the bed.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.960
I don't care what you do,
as long as you do it quietly.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
# It's a rich man's... #

14:05.960 --> 14:08.960
God, look at the size of it, man.
Oh, that is beautiful.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.960
Jesus Christ.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.960
Oh, my God.
That is... Oh, my God.

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
SCOTT INHALES SHARPLY

14:16.960 --> 14:18.960
Oh, this is the moment of truth,
innit?

14:18.960 --> 14:21.480
# All the things I could do... #
Man.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.960
Shall we open it?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.960
Let's go for it.
Does it open on that side?

14:24.960 --> 14:25.960
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.800
# It's a rich man's...

14:31.800 --> 14:33.000
# World. #

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
Ooh, this is the moment of truth,
innit?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.960
Let's go for it.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.960
OK, I can work with nothing.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.640
I'm happy.
Keeps me safe. Keeps me happy.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.320
CHLOE: Let's do it.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.960
Thank God.
Thank you. Yes!

15:02.960 --> 15:05.960
That's the ideal.
That's what we wanted. Wow.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.960
I just don't want
that Checkout card.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.960
Lucky number. I've got this.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
Baby!
HE CHUCKLES

15:18.960 --> 15:21.000
Ah, it's not money.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.960
But still the same,
we're on the safe side. We're safe.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.160
Best-case scenario is nothing.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.960
We just don't wanna get
the Early Checkout Card. Yeah.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.800
Shall we open?
Shall we have a look?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.960
Oh, brilliant.
Result.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.000
Are you feeling lucky?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.480
No.
What do you reckon?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.640
No.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.960
Shall I open it, then?
Yeah, you open it.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
Here we go.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.960
No!
THEY LAUGH

15:52.960 --> 15:55.960
Oh, my God.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.960
OK.
Brilliant.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
We need to get rid of it.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
Oh, just our luck.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.960
HE LAUGHS
Well, the room's nice.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.960
'I'm Lesley, I'm 55,
and I'm from Suffolk.'

16:08.960 --> 16:10.960
And you are?

16:10.960 --> 16:13.320
I... I'm Gary.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.960
I'm 60, and I'm from Suffolk.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.960
Let's think, right,
if we did have the money,

16:18.960 --> 16:22.960
we'd be not wanting them
to steal it.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.960
Whereas we do want them
to steal this one.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.960
So if we act
like we've got the money,

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
they are gonna wanna take it.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.160
Just don't overplay it.
No.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.960
We met in a queue in a nightclub,
and we do like banter.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.960
We mess about a lot.
HE HONKS

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
That kind of thing.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.960
I brought you for the fact
that you're quite lucky,

16:43.960 --> 16:44.960
and that hasn't worked.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.960
But we might get rid of it.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Since being made redundant,

16:47.960 --> 16:52.960
to get that £250,000
is gonna change our life.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.960
It's gonna make it a lot more
comfortable than it is now.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.160
And obviously,
no financial troubles.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.960
# Money, money, money

17:01.960 --> 17:04.320
# Must be funny... #

17:04.320 --> 17:05.960
What are we hoping for?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.960
Money.
Money?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.000
I want to be the Fortune Holder.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.800
Ready?
BOTH: Three... two... one.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.960
OK. That is good.
I'm happy with that.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.960
I feel very relieved.
I'm very relieved.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.960
Let's hope we picked the right one,
darling.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
Let's hope so.
THEY CHUCKLE

17:26.960 --> 17:29.960
Shall we open it?
OK.

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
THEY SIGH

17:30.960 --> 17:32.320
OK.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.960
It's a bla...
WHISPERING: Shh, shh! It's paper.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
It's paper.
I know that. I know.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.960
ADAM: Ready?

17:46.960 --> 17:49.960
Guess.
Is it nothing?

17:49.960 --> 17:50.960
Yeah, it is. Yeah.
Is it?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.960
Yeah, look.
Phew!

17:52.960 --> 17:55.960
We're still in the game. Someone's
got the 250 grand, haven't they?

17:55.960 --> 17:56.960
Shall we open it?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.000
You do that side, I'll do this side.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.960
Three...

18:01.960 --> 18:03.960
BOTH: Two...

18:03.960 --> 18:05.960
Wait, wait, wait!
SHE SQUEALS

18:08.960 --> 18:11.960
OK.
Where's the money at?

18:13.960 --> 18:14.960
THEY GASP
Fucking hell.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.640
Fuck's sake.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.960
SHE LAUGHS

18:22.960 --> 18:24.960
Oh, my God, Will.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.960
Oh, my... I want to cry.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
We've not won it yet!
What are you crying for?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
I know, I know.
Pull yourself together, man.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.960
Hiya, I'm Jo-Anne.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.960
I'm Will, and this is my mum.
SHE CHUCKLES

18:34.960 --> 18:36.960
I knew I could smell an handbag.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.800
What you on about?
We've not won it yet, Mum.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.960
Our relationship, it's a whirlwind,
to say the least, innit?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
It's not always perfect, is it?
It's not always perfect.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.480
But it's loving.
But it's loving.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.480
It is loving.
It's loving. It's full of laughter.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.960
It's full of banter.
It's full of winding each other up.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Never seen that amount of money.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
It's all right looking
at someone else's money.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.960
It's not ours.
It might be mine for half the day.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
What would we do with the money,
Will, if we won it?

19:00.960 --> 19:01.960
First things first,

19:01.960 --> 19:04.160
what I'm looking forward to
if we win this money

19:04.160 --> 19:06.320
is not having
to have a four-minute shower.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.960
Look how beautiful she looks.
SHE CHUCKLES

19:09.960 --> 19:12.960
Right, close that. I'm fed up
of looking at it. Oh, Will.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.960
When we go back downstairs now,
and we see everyone...

19:14.960 --> 19:17.960
I'll be poker face, don't worry.
I'll turn it on, don't worry.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.960
Aw, God.
Just get...

19:19.960 --> 19:22.960
What you...?
Mum, it's not our money.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.960
You're doing my head in now.
Pack it in.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.960
Honestly, Mum, I'm being serious.
Pack that in.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.000
You've got make-up all over box
as well.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.960
Hi!
Hi, Jen. How you doing?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.000
Hi.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.960
Ah!
Hi.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.960
Hiya. You all right?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
Ah!
Let's talk money.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.960
Aw!
THEY LAUGH

19:50.960 --> 19:54.160
What's in your boxes?
What's in your boxes, guys?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.960
I think you're gonna get
the same answer from us pretty much

19:56.960 --> 19:59.960
throughout this whole thing.
No matter what is in our briefcase.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.960
Are you...? Are you good at lying?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.480
Of course he is. He's a lawyer.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.960
LAUGHTER

20:04.960 --> 20:07.320
Lawyer, not liar.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.960
Yeah.
THEY LAUGH

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
Have you guys got a game plan?
Would you keep quiet?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.160
Or would you say to us now,
"Oh, I've got that in there"?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.960
No, I'd keep it quiet, obviously.
Not silly.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
We'd say.
Yeah. Yeah.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
D'you wanna know? D'you wanna know?
Yeah.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.000
Well, you want us to know, so go on.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.960
No, no.
You gotta ask us the question.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.960
What's in your case?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
Nothing. Literally nothing.
Got nothing in there.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.960
The reason we've chose this strategy
of just being honest and open

20:32.960 --> 20:34.960
is because that's how
we wanna come across.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.320
And I think if people do find out
what's in our case,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.960
and we're being honest with them,
we're building trust.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.160
What you got in yours, then?
We ain't telling you.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.960
Oh, come on, Mum.
No.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.960
Come on.
No. Absolutely not.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.960
CHLOE: 'Will and Jo - absolute love.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.960
'Michael and Adam -
really nice guys.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.960
And I genuinely think

20:53.960 --> 20:55.640
that they haven't got anything
in the case.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.960
Yeah. They definitely haven't
got anything in the case.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
Are you feeling lucky today?

20:59.960 --> 21:04.000
I'm one of life's losers.
All the luck comes from Lesley.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.480
What about you, Lesley?
Are you feeling lucky today?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.960
Yeah, I think so.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.960
To be honest with you, actually...

21:12.800 --> 21:15.960
THEY LAUGH

21:15.960 --> 21:17.960
Did that not look like interrogation
to me?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.320
MICHAEL: 'Gary and Lesley
are a bit excited.'

21:24.320 --> 21:25.960
He was bouncing off the walls.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.960
I feel like he's opened up that
briefcase, he's seen that money,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.960
and he's thought, "Jackpot."
He's spent it.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.960
Hello. Hi.
ALL: Hi!

21:35.960 --> 21:36.960
May I join you?
Hi.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.960
You all right?
Good. Amazing.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.000
Settled in?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.960
Yeah? You've got your cases?
ALL: Yes.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.800
Two of you have just become
the Fortune Holders.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.000
You're holding onto £250,000.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.960
Two of you have just become
the Unfortunates.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.960
There are four people in this room
who are hiding something.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.000
Who are they?

22:08.960 --> 22:12.960
Michael and Adam, if I was
to push you to pick somebody here

22:12.960 --> 22:16.960
that you think might have it,
which pair would you go for?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
We think maybe Gary and Lesley.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.960
LAUGHTER

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
We're with you.
What? Got the money?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.160
Yeah.
You think we've got the money?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.960
Look at Abbie and thingy.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.800
Gary's got some swag this afternoon.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.960
Has he?
Yeah, like, he's a different man.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.960
For Adam and Michael to say

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
that they think
Gary and Lesley have got it,

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
it's a massive sigh of relief.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.480
I just kept thinking, "God,
when they realise we've conned them,

22:43.480 --> 22:45.960
"oh, God, they're never gonna
talk to us again." I know.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.160
This is a fun experiment.
Let's go round.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.960
Will?
We're in agreement.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.960
You're in agreement?
Gary and Lesley?

22:53.960 --> 22:54.960
Gary and Lesley, yeah.
Who said that?

22:54.960 --> 22:57.320
Oh, OK. You're attracting some heat,
Gary and Lesley.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.800
What's going on here?
LAUGHTER

22:59.800 --> 23:02.000
Louie and Chloe?
We think Dan.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.640
We think Claire and Dan
have the money.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.960
Claire and Dan?
Yeah.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
What have you two done?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.320
OK, then,
a chance to get your own back.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.160
Who are you going for?
So, I would say Chloe and Louie.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.960
OK.
Well done for speaking out.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Yeah, good.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
Cherish and Jae,
who are you going for?

23:20.960 --> 23:23.960
There's one person here...

23:23.960 --> 23:25.960
with his top off, enjoying life,

23:25.960 --> 23:28.800
and it's Adam.
LAUGHTER

23:28.800 --> 23:29.960
Mike and Adam have the money.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.960
Trust me, if we had 250 grand,

23:31.960 --> 23:33.960
I wouldn't be wearing the shorts
either.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.480
LAUGHTER

23:38.960 --> 23:41.160
Well, I'm gonna have to agree
with Cherish and Jae.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.320
The pair of them look far too happy
over there.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.960
'To be honest, I'm a bit surprised
they think we've got the money.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.000
We've got nothing. Nothing to hide.
We're just chilled.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.960
But you've just got a T-shirt off,
and if that's all they can find...

23:51.960 --> 23:53.960
BOTH: ..then so be it.
Yeah, exactly.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.960
Interesting. Abbie and Tracey,
who's hiding something here?

23:57.960 --> 24:00.960
Lesley and Gary.
Gary and Lesley.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.960
Samm and Aysha?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.960
We've had it in for our friend Gary
this whole time.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.160
No trust in here, is there?

24:06.160 --> 24:08.960
There is no trust.
Well, it's very interesting.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.480
I think that means, Gary and Lesley,
four pairs think you have the money.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.160
Ah, yeah, but what do they know?
LAUGHTER

24:15.160 --> 24:16.960
OK. Time to get your own back.
Who do you think?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.960
There's only one couple...
a bit of suspicion.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.960
Susan and Jen.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.960
Yes. OK.
Yeah.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.480
So, Gary and Lesley,

24:26.480 --> 24:29.960
why don't you swap cases
with Susan and Jen?

24:29.960 --> 24:32.800
Ooh!

24:33.960 --> 24:36.640
Oh, my God.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.960
My butt cheeks clenched, I thought,
"Oh, that could have been us."

24:38.960 --> 24:41.480
Oh, my God.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.960
It's been game on,
but now it's properly game on.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.960
So, Gary and Lesley,

24:59.960 --> 25:03.960
why don't you swap cases
with Susan and Jen?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.960
And, Lesley, before you sit down,

25:11.960 --> 25:13.960
you wanna know what's in it,
don't you? I do.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
Why don't you come up here
and open it?

25:21.320 --> 25:22.960
Oh, my God.

25:28.960 --> 25:29.960
Thank you.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.960
Anyone notice anything there?

25:32.960 --> 25:35.800
Look proud as punch.
Look really happy.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.960
Susan and Jen, we need you to have
a look in your case as well, please.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.000
What have Gary and Lesley
just given you?

25:53.320 --> 25:54.960
It was a shock.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.960
We were Fortune Hunters,

25:56.960 --> 25:59.480
and all of a sudden,
we've become Unfortunates.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.640
Didn't expect that to happen.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.960
I think we carried it off OK.
Uh-huh.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
BOTH: We passed the test.
Uh-huh.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.960
Thanks very much.
Early Checkout.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
Well, there you go.
Let that be a lesson.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.960
You may be living
in the lap of luxury,

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
but you shouldn't get too
comfortable at The Fortune Hotel.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.000
I can't believe we get to off-load
the early checkout card

26:21.000 --> 26:23.960
without even having to do anything,
right result.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.960
Did you get the Early Checkout?

26:25.960 --> 26:28.960
You look like
youse were pretty peed off.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.960
I'm not gonna tell you
if I got what I got, am I?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.960
Are you not happy, though?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.960
LAUGHTER
No.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.000
I'm not gonna kind of just...
It is what it is.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.960
Chloe with the fire.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.960
No, just asking.
Youse all wanted to ask.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.160
LAUGHTER

26:44.160 --> 26:45.960
That's just... Wow.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.960
I think they've definitely
got the Early Checkout.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.960
Hi. We're Chloe and Louie,
and we're best friends.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.960
Our friendship
turned into business partners

26:55.960 --> 26:58.960
to best friends,
and it's just, like, meant to be.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.960
I've got more common sense,
but he's more academically clever.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.320
Yeah.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.960
And then, obviously,
we both, like, look good.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.960
And we're both equally as beautiful.
Yeah.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.480
So, I need you
to get yourselves ready

27:10.480 --> 27:12.960
for your first Day Trip Challenge.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.960
Gather up your belongings,

27:13.960 --> 27:18.000
and prepare yourselves
for a photo finish.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.960
See you in a bit.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.960
# You made me a
You made me a believer

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
# Believer... #

27:29.960 --> 27:32.960
Absolutely pumped
for this Day Trip Challenge.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.960
Start off with a bang, don't we?
Get the first place.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.960
Let people know we mean business.
Definitely.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.800
# Believer... #

27:41.960 --> 27:46.480
Hello! Welcome
to your first Day Trip Challenge,

27:46.480 --> 27:49.960
here at historic Fort Frederick.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.960
Now, I can see
what you're all thinking.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.960
You're thinking, "Doesn't Stephen
look good in shorts?"

27:54.960 --> 27:57.960
Come on, guys, stop it.
Get your head in the game.

27:57.960 --> 28:02.960
So, this challenge is where
you could gain a crucial advantage

28:02.960 --> 28:05.960
going into the nightcap
at the Lady Luck Bar.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.960
Because tonight,
you will all get the chance

28:07.960 --> 28:10.960
to either swap or keep your case.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.960
And where you place in the challenge
will dictate the order

28:13.960 --> 28:15.960
in which those decisions
will be made.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.800
If you win the challenge,

28:17.800 --> 28:20.960
you will have
the all-important final swap,

28:20.960 --> 28:23.960
and that, trust me,
is the best place to be.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.960
JEN: 'The pressure
has increased slightly.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.960
'I want to do well because I would
like to have the pick of the bunch.'

28:30.960 --> 28:32.960
Let's get rid of
the Early Checkout Card. Yeah.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.960
However, if you finish last
in this challenge,

28:35.960 --> 28:38.960
you'll be swapping first tonight,

28:38.960 --> 28:42.160
and you will have to swap
whether you want to or not.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.960
So, if you're the Fortune Holders,

28:43.960 --> 28:46.960
you'll be forced
to give away that money.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
JO-ANNE: 'We have got
to keep the money.'

28:48.960 --> 28:50.000
WILL: 'I feel a little bit
of pressure.'

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Because we don't want to come last,
do we?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.320
No, no, no.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.960
In today's Day Trip Challenge,

28:55.960 --> 29:00.640
you will be doing
the quintessential tourist activity,

29:00.640 --> 29:03.960
taking selfies at local landmarks.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.960
In a minute, you're gonna be
going to your vehicle.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.160
In each vehicle is a map,

29:11.160 --> 29:16.000
which contains clues to various
local hotspots all over town.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.960
All you have to do
is solve the clues,

29:18.960 --> 29:22.640
find the location,
and snap a selfie.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.960
The first pair
to reach the finish line

29:24.960 --> 29:27.800
with the most correct selfies

29:27.800 --> 29:31.000
will win the first
Day Trip Challenge.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.960
You have 45 minutes.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
Are you ready?
ALL: Yeah!

29:34.960 --> 29:37.960
I wish you good fortune. Go!

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
JEN: Reading maps
is not a strength of mine.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.960
Are we allowed sat nav?

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
Shall we just read
all of the things first

29:47.960 --> 29:49.800
so at least
we know what to look for?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.160
"Where sticks bang steel,
come strike a pose,

29:52.160 --> 29:55.640
"you'll find us
opposite a hero's hose."

29:55.640 --> 29:57.960
Can we head towards
the fire station, please?

29:57.960 --> 30:01.960
"You'll find me swimming in the sea,
come and take a snap with me."

30:01.960 --> 30:04.960
"I'm speedy on the seas,
as my name alludes,

30:04.960 --> 30:07.960
"I'm named after
the Caribbean's favourite booze."

30:07.960 --> 30:10.960
"Grated or ground
and a spicy delight,

30:10.960 --> 30:12.960
"snap me with a trader
to get your shot right."

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
Nutmeg?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.800
"To end the game,
meet me at the finish line.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.960
"Don't get stumped,
and you should be fine."

30:18.960 --> 30:20.960
Abbie, we're not doing very good
at the minute.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.160
I'll look this way.
I'll look this way.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.960
I'll look this way,
you look that way. Calm.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.480
"I'm speedy on the seas,
as my name alludes,

30:27.480 --> 30:29.960
"and named after
a Caribbean favourite booze."

30:29.960 --> 30:31.960
Dojo.
Is that a booze?

30:31.960 --> 30:34.960
Yeah, it's Dojo.
Right, so let's go Dojo.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.960
So, this is the fire station here.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.320
Right.
It's steel drums. There we go.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.960
THEY PLAY 'RED RED WINE'

30:40.960 --> 30:42.960
Right, follow me.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.960
Thank you.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
Hi!

30:58.960 --> 31:01.320
I think Dan and Claire
and Mike and Adam

31:01.320 --> 31:04.960
have got one over on us in terms of
physical ability. Oh, yeah.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.320
That doesn't mean

31:06.320 --> 31:09.960
that they might not
read a clue incorrectly.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
There!
Go on, get in!

31:10.960 --> 31:12.160
Tracey, where are we going?

31:12.160 --> 31:13.960
Down there.
Fire station. Fire station.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.320
This can't be it.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.960
This isn't it,
and we're just wasting time.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.640
Shall we just get moving?
Cos we're just...

31:28.640 --> 31:30.960
We could be moving
to somewhere else.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.480
"I'm speedy on the seas,
as my name alludes,

31:32.480 --> 31:34.960
"and named after
the Caribbean's favourite booze."

31:34.960 --> 31:37.960
Is there anything we've missed?
There's Rhum Runner there.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.960
You are a legend.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
"Named after the Caribbean booze."
Rum.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.960
See if there's a name
on any of the boats.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
There's nothing on that one.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.000
It's rum, innit?
It's a bottle of rum, innit? Get in!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.800
I spotted a nice little bottle
of white rum

31:49.800 --> 31:51.960
sitting in the rickety old boat.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.960
How clever are we? Oi-oi!
Ho-ho!

31:55.960 --> 31:57.160
Let's go back to the taxi.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.640
Let's keep an eye out
in case we do see a boat called Rum.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.960
Come on!
I was reading the boat.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
Louie, we need to be
looking out for things.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.960
Oh, my God,
we're gonna so lose this, baby.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.960
Don't worry, darling.
We're gonna be tenth.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
We're going home.
"Sticks bang steel!"

32:12.960 --> 32:14.960
Oh, my God!
Steel drums! Stop!

32:16.960 --> 32:18.960
"I'm speedy on the seas,
as my name alludes,

32:18.960 --> 32:20.960
"and named after
the Caribbean favourite booze."

32:20.960 --> 32:21.960
Rum!
Oh, yeah.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.160
Bar. Might be the rum distillery,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.000
and if it is, I'm staying there.
Yeah.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.960
Here you are.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.160
Rhum Runner.
Yeah.

32:33.960 --> 32:34.960
Rhum Runner.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.960
So, let's just take a picture here.
Hello.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.160
Tony's bar.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.160
That's the selfie, with that.
Oh, right. Come on, then.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.960
Louie, I think we've gone too far.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.640
Carib. The name of the local beer.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.960
Get a picture of these people.
What are you...?

32:53.960 --> 32:55.960
The Caribbean's favourite booze
is Carib.

32:55.960 --> 32:56.960
Hi, you OK?
Are you sure?

32:56.960 --> 32:58.960
Selfie. Yes, it is.
It's not.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.000
I am more normally right.
D'you think?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.960
You know I am, cos you always
come round in the end.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.960
No, the other way round.
We'll have to agree to disagree.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.960
No.
THEY LAUGH

33:09.960 --> 33:11.960
"At Market Square
is the grated or ground.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
"I'm a spicy delight.

33:12.960 --> 33:16.800
"Snap me with a trader
to get your shot right."

33:16.800 --> 33:19.960
I think we're focused
on getting nutmeg and a trader.

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
The market's up here.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.960
Hi. Would you mind
if we took a photo of some nutmeg

33:23.960 --> 33:24.960
with yourselves?
Thank you.

33:24.960 --> 33:25.960
Thank you very much.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.960
Thank you. Smile!

33:29.960 --> 33:32.000
D'you wanna get in it?
Come on.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.960
"You'll find me swimming in the sea.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.640
BOTH: "Come and take a snap
with me."

33:36.640 --> 33:39.640
I'm sure there's a fish called
a snapper, or something like that.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.960
Hello!
We're looking for a fish that snaps.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.960
Aye! Perfect.
Look at that beauty.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.960
That is one hell of a fish.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.960
Fish market. Fish market.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.960
"Come and take a snap with me."
I'm thinking it's a crab.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.640
It's BB's Crabback.
We've gotta take a picture with it.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.320
Take a photo with the fish, right?
Is that...?

33:59.320 --> 34:00.960
I feel like that sounds right.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.640
D'you know where BB's Crabback is?

34:02.640 --> 34:03.960
To the left.
This?

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
Yeah.
Amazing!

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
Oh, we've got a snap with a snapper!

34:07.960 --> 34:09.960
LAUGHTER

34:09.960 --> 34:11.320
It could be a fish market.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.320
It could also be a statue,
because it's in the sea.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.960
We're just taking pictures in hope
that they're the right answer.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.960
D'you know what?
We've actually smashed that, though.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.000
"To end the game,
meet me at the finish line.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.640
BOTH: "Don't get stumped."

34:25.640 --> 34:27.960
"Stumped", that's the cricket.
So the cricket's the end.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.960
Yeah, cricket stadium, please.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
Read it back. "Don't get stumped."

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
That's the...
"DON'T get stumped."

34:33.960 --> 34:35.960
The finish line's
at the athletics track.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.640
Whoa!
THEY LAUGH

34:38.640 --> 34:39.960
How far away is it, please?

34:39.960 --> 34:42.320
DRIVER: Two minutes.
Two minutes. Lovely.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.960
This is obviously
the cricket ground.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.480
"To end the game..."
Ah. "DON'T get stumped!"

34:48.480 --> 34:50.640
I'm looking down,
and you just see that "don't"

34:50.640 --> 34:52.960
in capital letters.
You're like, "Oh."

34:52.960 --> 34:55.960
Would do you mind taking us
to the athletics stadium, please?

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
We're just out, and we go, mate.
We're just out, and we go.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.800
Right. Here we go.

34:59.800 --> 35:00.960
We're here.
We've made it.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
Right, we're here.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.960
This is the track.
This is the track.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.480
Go, go, go. Go on, Usain.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.960
Come on, then. Come on, then.
Come on, then.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
Who's it gonna be?

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
Yes! Look at them go!

35:16.960 --> 35:20.960
Come on!
Flying! Yes!

35:20.960 --> 35:22.960
Adam takes it!
I had a head start.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.960
We won the race,
blew everyone out of the water,

35:24.960 --> 35:27.960
and we showed everyone
that we're in it to win it.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.960
Oh, it's Dan and Claire.
Come on.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.320
Oh, that's a proper marriage, that.
Yes!

35:33.320 --> 35:34.960
"To end the game,
meet at the finish line.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
"Don't get stumped,
and you'll be fine."

35:36.960 --> 35:38.960
Stump, tree stump.
Stump is like a tree stump.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.960
And, like,
tropical botanical gardens.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.800
Yeah, it's sitting right with me.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.960
Let's hope we're not the last people
on this.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
Yes!

35:54.960 --> 35:56.960
LAUGHTER
Woohoo!

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
Yes! Yes!

35:58.960 --> 36:00.960
You look shattered. Bless you.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.960
Your time is up. I'm taking you
to your final destination.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
Shit.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.960
I literally feel
like we got 'em all right.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Come on!

36:15.960 --> 36:17.960
Well done.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.960
You found us.
Oh! Eventually.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.960
All right, everyone. Well done.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.000
So, the results.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.960
The pair who came in last place,

36:28.960 --> 36:33.800
and who'll be making that compulsory
first swap tonight, is...

36:33.800 --> 36:35.960
'We know that we won the challenge.'

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
There's no way that we come last.
I'm just not having it.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.800
So, the results.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.320
The pair who came in last place,

36:52.320 --> 36:56.960
and who'll be making that
compulsory first swap tonight, is...

36:56.960 --> 36:58.960
Chloe and Louie.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:01.640 --> 37:02.960
You got one right.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.960
We was adamant we won the challenge.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.960
LOUIE: But we lost.
Yeah.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.960
We lost because,
one, you wouldn't run, and two...

37:09.960 --> 37:12.960
We went to the wrong destination.
..we got the wrong places.

37:12.960 --> 37:16.960
In ninth place with the second swap,

37:16.960 --> 37:18.960
it's Aysha and Samm.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:20.960 --> 37:23.000
Cherish and Jae finish in eighth.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.640
In seventh is Abbie and Tracey.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.960
Lesley and Gary take sixth.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.320
And fifth place goes
to Tommy and Scott.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.800
So, we're into our final four.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.960
And remember,
correct selfies are more important

37:34.960 --> 37:37.960
than the time taken
to finish the race.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.960
In fourth place, it's...

37:40.960 --> 37:42.000
Michael and Adam.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:43.960 --> 37:45.960
It's probably a little bit
of a blessing,

37:45.960 --> 37:47.960
because we haven't gone bang up
to number one or two

37:47.960 --> 37:49.960
on the leaderboard,
we've gone fourth.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.960
So maybe people are thinking,

37:51.960 --> 37:53.960
"Well, they might be quick,
but they're also thick."

37:53.960 --> 37:55.960
THEY LAUGH

37:55.960 --> 37:57.960
In third place, we have...

37:57.960 --> 37:59.960
Susan and Jen.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:02.640 --> 38:04.160
JEN: To come in top three
is amazing.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.960
It puts us in such a high place

38:06.960 --> 38:08.960
for the swap at the Lady Luck Bar
tonight. Yes.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.960
So, there's only two pairs left -

38:11.960 --> 38:13.960
Jo-Anne and Will,
and Daniel and Claire.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
Who will take top spot?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.960
In second position,

38:17.960 --> 38:19.960
it's Jo-Anne and Will.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:22.160 --> 38:25.960
All right!
Oh, God, I can't believe it.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.960
Well done.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.960
Which means, in first place,
of course, it is...

38:30.960 --> 38:31.960
Dan and Claire.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Well done, guys.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.640
Got all five right.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.960
Tonight, you will have the final
and most powerful swap.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.960
So, it's almost time
for the nightcap,

38:43.960 --> 38:46.960
where one pair will be checking out
of The Fortune Hotel.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.480
See you all there.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.960
DAN: Looking up at that scoreboard
and seeing our name in lights,

38:54.960 --> 38:56.960
it's just so cool.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.960
And at number one,
makes it all the better.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
CHLOE: To be honest,
I feel like we give it our best,

39:00.960 --> 39:02.000
and we didn't give up.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.320
The classical loser story.
Yeah, but, shit, this is real now.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.960
# I think we're alone now... #

39:21.960 --> 39:24.960
TOMMY: I don't think
I've ever felt so tense in my life.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.960
SCOTT: I don't think
there could be anything worse

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
than going home on day one.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
And you can tell,
it's painted on everyone's face.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.800
Everyone is bricking it,
going in there.

39:31.800 --> 39:36.960
# I think we're alone now... #

39:36.960 --> 39:38.960
LESLEY: The worst thing
that could happen

39:38.960 --> 39:40.000
is getting the Checkout Card
back again.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.960
Anything else is fine at this stage.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.960
Going into tonight,
I'm feeling quite confident.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.960
I don't think many people
have an idea where the money is.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.960
So, hopefully, nobody's gonna want
to take our case.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
# We're alone... #

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
We're going into Lady Luck Bar
without a concern

39:59.960 --> 40:01.960
that we're out of the competition.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
Because we know, as we walk in,

40:03.960 --> 40:05.960
if somebody gives us
the Early Checkout Card,

40:05.960 --> 40:07.960
we've got the final choice,
we can give it to somebody else.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.960
I'm quite confident
about our position tonight.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.160
We know we have
the Early Checkout Card,

40:16.160 --> 40:19.960
so we kind of have
a slight upper hand

40:19.960 --> 40:22.960
against seven other couples.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.960
Going into Lady Luck coming last,
we are in the firing line.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.960
If people wanna chase the money,
they'll be chasing the money.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.960
If people see us as competition,
they'll be getting us out.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.960
So, yeah, we're in a bit
of a sticky situation right now,

40:33.960 --> 40:36.160
but what will be, will be.

40:36.160 --> 40:41.960
# We're alone... #

40:45.960 --> 40:47.960
Good evening.

40:47.960 --> 40:48.960
ALL: Evening.
Hello, everyone.

40:48.960 --> 40:53.960
Welcome, welcome, to the nightcap
in the Lady Luck Bar.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.960
You all look sensational.
It's been quite a day.

40:55.960 --> 41:00.960
We've had shocking swaps,
silly selfies, run all over town.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.320
Chloe and Louie,
you tried your hearts out today.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.960
Yeah, we did.
But you have the first swap.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.960
How are you feeling?
Erm, nervous.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.320
We didn't think
that we'd lose the challenge.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.320
We knew
that somebody's gonna go home.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.640
Hopefully, we get to stay.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.960
Dan and Claire,
you won the challenge.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.800
Do you think, by winning today,

41:21.800 --> 41:23.960
you might have put a target
on your back? Yes.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.960
Abbie and Tracey.
I've been told to keep that...

41:29.960 --> 41:31.960
Oh, really? "Don't speak, Mum."

41:31.960 --> 41:34.960
I just feel my mum's too open.
I see. She'll give everything away.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.960
Susan and Jen, how are the nerves?

41:38.960 --> 41:42.960
Same as everyone else.
We're all nervous.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.960
But things could go badly,
obviously, you could go home,

41:45.960 --> 41:46.960
but you could,
by the end of the night,

41:46.960 --> 41:49.640
be holding the £250,000 case.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.320
I think that's probably
what everyone is feeling. It's...

41:52.320 --> 41:54.960
"How could we be leaving here?
Is it for the last time?

41:54.960 --> 41:58.960
"Or is it gonna be one step closer
to being considerably richer?"

41:59.960 --> 42:03.000
Right.
Before we get to the swapping,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.960
this is your last chance

42:05.960 --> 42:08.960
to influence
how people are gonna act,

42:08.960 --> 42:12.960
and to keep yourselves in the game.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.960
I think that everyone should really,
really have a think about,

42:15.960 --> 42:17.960
like, who's won the challenge.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.960
Because the first person
that's won the challenge

42:20.960 --> 42:23.960
and won by clear miles
is really your competition.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.000
And you need to really think about
at what point you can get them out.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.480
I take your point totally about,
you know,

42:30.480 --> 42:32.800
getting out the people
who are the biggest threat.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.960
Wouldn't say we're necessarily
the biggest threat.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.960
I didn't literally say "you".

42:37.960 --> 42:39.640
It would be a bit naive to say

42:39.640 --> 42:41.960
that you won't look at other people
as your competition,

42:41.960 --> 42:43.800
and realistically play the game,

42:43.800 --> 42:46.960
which would be the person
that keeps winning the challenges.

42:46.960 --> 42:50.960
That's just logic.
No, I know, but we were lucky.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.960
And we appreciate
that we were lucky today.

42:53.960 --> 42:57.000
If you've got five questions right
out of five, that's not luck.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.480
It's literally a fact
that you've got them all right.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.800
There's nothing lucky about getting
all the questions in 30 minutes.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.960
All right, then.
Let's get on with it, shall we?

43:04.960 --> 43:07.960
Chloe and Louie, you came tenth
today in the challenge,

43:07.960 --> 43:10.960
which means
you have the first compulsory swap.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.960
Who would you like to swap with,
and why?

43:16.640 --> 43:19.960
We'd like to swap
with Will and Jo-Anne.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.960
Why are Chloe and Louie
swapping with us?

43:21.960 --> 43:23.960
They've got the whole room
to pick from.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.960
Why are they picking us?

43:25.960 --> 43:27.960
It's blown my mind, really.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.480
And why would you do that?

43:29.480 --> 43:31.960
Because we don't want them to go.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.960
So you're saying
you're giving them something nice?

43:33.960 --> 43:36.320
Yeah.
Do you believe that?

43:36.320 --> 43:37.960
Don't know yet. We'll soon see.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.960
All right, then. Here we go.
Please swap cases.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.960
It's hard giving this case over.
It's like giving your baby away.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.960
But all I'm thinking
in the back of my head is,

43:49.960 --> 43:51.640
"We're gonna get this back."

43:51.640 --> 43:54.960
Right. Well, based on the rankings,
next up, Aysha and Samm.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.800
What are you gonna do?

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
We have no idea where the money is,
but...

44:03.960 --> 44:06.960
I think we should just
keep our briefcase for now.

44:06.960 --> 44:07.960
No swap.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.320
OK. Next up, Cherish and Jae.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.160
Are you gonna stick,
or are you gonna swap?

44:15.160 --> 44:18.960
We're gonna keep our briefcase.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.960
Thanks, guys.
Abbie and Tracey, you're next.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.320
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

44:26.320 --> 44:27.960
You're gonna kill me.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.960
I'm gonna do the same tactic
as Samm.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.000
We'll keep it.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.960
You're gonna keep your case?

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
Yeah.
Yeah.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.960
Lesley and Gary.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.960
Oh, perhaps
we'll just follow suit... and stick.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.960
OK. Tommy and Scott.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.960
I think we're gonna
stick with our case.

44:47.960 --> 44:49.000
OK.
Play it safe.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.960
Five sticks, one swap.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.160
Keeping that case
could look suspicious.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.960
Because it means
you either have an empty case

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
or you have the money... probably.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.960
Coming to Michael and Adam.
What are you gonna do, gents?

45:02.960 --> 45:04.960
We are gonna stick.
We're gonna stick.

45:04.960 --> 45:08.960
Happy with what you've got?
For the time being.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.960
So, we're going
to the last three swaps.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.960
In a brilliant third place
this afternoon, Susan and Jen.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
What are you gonna do?

45:16.960 --> 45:18.960
It is not a comfortable situation
to be in,

45:18.960 --> 45:21.960
because we know
we're not going home,

45:21.960 --> 45:24.640
but we are definitely
sending somebody else home.

45:24.640 --> 45:27.960
Yeah. That's massive pressure.
Massive.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.960
Erm, we're gonna...

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
Susan and Jen,
what are you gonna do?

45:49.960 --> 45:52.960
'We can swap with anybody
who's already swapped.

45:52.960 --> 45:56.640
'Let's slide that stinky nappy
over to someone else.'

45:56.640 --> 45:58.960
Erm, we're gonna...

46:02.960 --> 46:05.960
Gary and Lesley did finish
after us,

46:05.960 --> 46:09.960
so we have to decide,
are we gifting that back?

46:09.960 --> 46:13.960
Do you think Susan and Jen might
try and give that card back to us?

46:13.960 --> 46:14.960
We've discussed this,

46:14.960 --> 46:17.960
and we think we've figured out
who had the money.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.960
So we're gonna follow the money,

46:19.960 --> 46:22.320
which has, we think,
already been swapped.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.960
Shit. They know where the money is.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.960
So, we would like to swap with...

46:30.800 --> 46:32.960
..Chloe and Louie, please.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.960
Interesting. You think
Chloe and Louie have the money?

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
We think that now they do, yeah.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.960
Why do you think that?

46:39.960 --> 46:43.960
Because we think Jo and Will
had the money originally.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.960
Thank you, guys.
Please swap with Chloe and Louie.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.160
That leaves only two couples.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.960
Jo-Anne and Will, you are next up.
We don't know what's in anything.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.960
We don't know what's in that.
We know what's in ours.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.960
She's got a point.
We've not got a clue what's in that.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.960
I know what's in that,
and I know it's safer than a risk,

47:14.960 --> 47:18.960
a shot in the dark opening that one.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.480
I'm not saying
you'd give us the card

47:20.480 --> 47:23.960
cos I don't think you would,
but I know that one's safe.

47:23.960 --> 47:24.960
I want that case back.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.960
You're getting it back,

47:26.960 --> 47:28.960
and as long as Dan and Claire
sat behind us,

47:28.960 --> 47:32.320
don't take it off us,
it's staying with us.

47:32.320 --> 47:35.960
So, your case went from you
to Louie and Chloe.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.640
From Louie and Chloe
to Susan and Jen,

47:38.640 --> 47:39.960
and you want it back?

47:39.960 --> 47:41.960
Oh, yeah. We're gonna swap.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.960
Back they go, then, please.

47:45.960 --> 47:49.960
Susan and Jen, of course,
are getting a new case.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.960
It was very interesting

47:51.960 --> 47:55.000
that Will and Jo
took their case back.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.480
That solidified for me
that they are, in fact,

47:58.480 --> 47:59.960
the Fortune Holders.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.960
The winners from this afternoon,
Dan and Claire.

48:03.960 --> 48:07.160
You can see now why it's so vital
to have the final swap.

48:07.160 --> 48:08.960
You've seen what everyone else
is up to.

48:08.960 --> 48:10.960
You know what's in your case.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.960
You can stick, you can twist.
What are you gonna do?

48:17.960 --> 48:21.960
Ours is gonna be far less dramatic
after this.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
We're gonna stick.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.960
Right. Well,
do we have new Fortune Holders?

48:27.960 --> 48:30.960
Do we have new Unfortunates?

48:31.960 --> 48:34.800
I think it's time to find out.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.960
Would both pairs holding a new case

48:36.960 --> 48:39.320
put your case on this plinth
and open them?

48:39.320 --> 48:40.960
Susan and Jen.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.960
And then Louie and Chloe.

49:00.960 --> 49:01.960
Thank you.

49:02.960 --> 49:06.960
Right. Let's not prolong the agony
any longer.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.160
It's time to find out

49:08.160 --> 49:11.960
who will be leaving
The Fortune Hotel tonight.

49:11.960 --> 49:15.160
Will the unfortunate pair
please stand up

49:15.160 --> 49:16.960
and reveal themselves?

49:20.960 --> 49:22.960
Chloe, Louie...

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
I'm afraid
you'll be leaving tonight.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.960
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?

49:26.960 --> 49:29.960
Obviously, we're just gutted
that we're out straightaway.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.640
We wanted to stay for longer,
but it is the game, in't it?

49:32.640 --> 49:34.320
I just think it's anyone's game,

49:34.320 --> 49:37.000
but Jo and Will,
I hope youse take it.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.960
Yeah, we hope you win.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.960
Aw.
Thank you.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.960
Well, it's time to swap the mini bar
for the mini cab to the airport.

49:44.960 --> 49:48.960
If you could please give me
your case and say your goodbyes.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.960
APPLAUSE

49:52.960 --> 49:54.960
I'm really sorry.
It's OK.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
I'm so sorry.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
They just didn't deserve that
at all.

49:58.960 --> 50:05.960
They were just two beautiful people
with very, very kind hearts.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.000
Lovely while it lasted.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.960
Back to work.
Literally.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.480
Back to the scrubs.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.480
Nine pairs left.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.960
We're almost finished for tonight,

50:18.960 --> 50:23.960
but there is one last piece
of unfinished business.

50:23.960 --> 50:27.960
You might be wondering
what is gonna happen to this.

50:27.960 --> 50:31.960
Well, the Fortune Holders
not only are in possession

50:31.960 --> 50:34.960
of the £250,000 case,

50:34.960 --> 50:36.480
they also get to go
to their rooms now

50:36.480 --> 50:37.960
and secretly decide

50:37.960 --> 50:41.960
which pair are going to be
given this cursed card.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.960
The Early Checkout Card.

50:45.960 --> 50:50.960
Later tonight, a new pair
will become the Unfortunates.

50:50.960 --> 50:54.160
Fortune Holders, well done.

50:54.160 --> 50:57.800
You're winning.
Fortune Hunters, try harder.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.640
Good night, and good luck.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.480
# I walk alone

51:04.480 --> 51:07.960
# I walk alone... #

51:11.960 --> 51:14.960
WILL SIGHS
Oh, my God, Will.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
That was just an absolute mare.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.960
I don't know
if I can do another one of them.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.320
That was horrendous.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.640
I genuinely don't think
I can do another one of them.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.960
That was absolutely awful.

51:22.960 --> 51:26.800
I feel absolutely gutted.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.960
Gutted for Chloe and Louie.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.960
I know. They...
They were just saving us.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.960
They was just trying
to do us a favour.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.480
Just in case.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.640
Right, let's say bye to the room.
Bye!

51:37.640 --> 51:40.960
It was short but sweet. Let's go.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.000
Jen was sending us home anyway.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.960
She's had it in for us
from the beginning.

51:43.960 --> 51:44.960
It wasn't about the money,

51:44.960 --> 51:48.960
it was just big personalities...
get 'em out.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.640
And she got us out.

51:51.640 --> 51:54.480
# I walk alone... #

51:54.480 --> 51:56.960
I'm really not that upset...
No, I'm not.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.960
..that Chloe and Louie have gone,
to be honest with you.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.960
I'm not gonna lose any sleep
over that one.

52:00.960 --> 52:03.960
I didn't appreciate
when we did the swap

52:03.960 --> 52:05.000
with Gary and Lesley.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.960
Oh, she totally threw us
under the bus.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.480
Exactly, yeah.

52:08.480 --> 52:11.160
I'm not gonna lie,
that got my back up and...

52:11.160 --> 52:13.960
Is that why I chose you?

52:13.960 --> 52:16.960
If I'm honest, yeah, part of it was.
You pissed me off.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.960
# I walk alone... #

52:25.960 --> 52:28.960
What a twist, though,
that the Fortune Holders

52:28.960 --> 52:30.960
now get to issue...
Yes.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.960
..the Early Checkout Card
to whoever they want.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.000
Mm-hm.
I...

52:37.000 --> 52:39.960
I'm a bit nervous
that we've maybe put...

52:39.960 --> 52:41.960
a target on our back now.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.960
And we've got to put that
under someone's door tonight.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.960
I think Abbie and Tracey.

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
Why?

52:50.960 --> 52:52.960
They're cleverer
than they're making out,

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
or at least the daughter is.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.960
The crying scene was an act.

52:56.960 --> 52:59.960
I'm gutted Chloe and Louie
are going.

52:59.960 --> 53:00.960
I loved them.

53:00.960 --> 53:04.800
Did you notice I started tearing up
and crying a bit?

53:04.800 --> 53:05.960
Yeah.
Weak link.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.000
Ooh, I'm really struggling
with this, Will.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.960
We don't wanna give it to someone
who's gonna be good in a challenge.

53:13.960 --> 53:15.480
They're gonna get the last swap.

53:15.480 --> 53:17.960
There's less chance of them getting
it. We want someone not good.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.960
Who's gonna do better in challenges,
Sue and Jen, or Abbie and Tracey?

53:20.960 --> 53:23.960
Jen and Sue. I really want
to give it to them pair.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.960
The snarl like she were giving us.
I couldn't look at her.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.160
Her eyes burn through your soul,
and I think she knows that.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.960
I think she knows she's terrifying.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.320
Shall we go with them, then?

53:39.320 --> 53:40.960
Yeah, are you sure?

53:40.960 --> 53:42.960
Are you sure?

53:42.960 --> 53:43.960
Yeah, I am.
I am as well.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.960
Definitely.
Let's get rid of it.

54:37.960 --> 54:40.000
