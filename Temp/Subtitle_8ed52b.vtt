00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
STEPHEN MANGAN: Welcome back
to The Fortune Hotel.

00:04.960 --> 00:05.960
Seven pairs remain...

00:07.960 --> 00:09.960
..all hoping to find the cash case

00:09.960 --> 00:12.960
to win a life-changing amount
of money

00:12.960 --> 00:14.960
and avoid an early checkout.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.000
Last time...

00:19.000 --> 00:21.960
Dan and Claire became a target.

00:22.960 --> 00:23.960
We're watching you.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.960
Michael and Adam found themselves
£10,000 richer.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.640
This card, we need to give it
to the weakest pairings.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.960
Wow. Going clear. OK.
Let the games begin.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.960
And Will and Jo-Anne got their hands
back on the fortune.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.640
WHISPERS: Go team.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.960
But after a surprise late swap
at the Nightcap...

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
What's going on right now?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.960
If you have the money,
why are you swapping?

00:52.960 --> 00:55.960
..Cherish and Jae
made a huge decision.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.960
The couple that we have decided
to swap with tonight

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
is Dan and Claire.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.960
Our vendetta is stronger
than getting the money.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.960
It was
Mission: Get Dan And Claire Out.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.960
Hopefully, another day,
we become the Fortune Holders.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
Dan and Claire,
anything you'd like to say?

01:26.960 --> 01:28.960
We thought that was going to happen.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.000
It's a tricky old game.

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
Please swap.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.960
MUSIC: 'Requiem in D minor, K 626'
by Mozart

01:40.960 --> 01:44.960
Obviously, the swap
of our cases with Adam and Michael

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
was done in secret.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
'So, now Cherish
and Jae have got the cash,

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
'they're gonna think
we've given them the card.'

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
So, yeah, we look like
the bad guys here,

01:52.960 --> 01:53.960
when, in reality, we're not.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.640
What I'd like you to do now,
for those of you with new cases,

02:00.640 --> 02:03.640
is ask you each to come up,
one by one, and open your case

02:03.640 --> 02:06.320
so we can all take a look
at your reaction.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.960
We had no idea
that Will and Jo had the money.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.960
It's time to find out

02:45.960 --> 02:48.960
who the pair
that are leaving this evening are.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.960
Would they please
make themselves known?

02:58.960 --> 03:02.480
Dan and Claire. Is there anything
you'd like to say at this point?

03:02.480 --> 03:06.960
We've had a really good time,
and we wish everyone all the best.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.960
Well, you're about to swap
a luxury spa for the airport bar.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.800
Could I ask Daniel and Claire
to please leave their case behind

03:14.800 --> 03:16.160
and check out of The Fortune Hotel?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.960
We had a target on our backs
right from the outset.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.960
Plainly, Cherish and Jae, no matter
what our case was going to be,

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
they were not looking
for the fortune tonight.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.000
They were looking to get rid of us.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.960
And so, what we thought
would happen has happened.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.960
It's just the way it goes.
APPLAUSE

03:35.960 --> 03:39.960
# There's no going back

03:39.960 --> 03:42.000
# Back... #

03:42.000 --> 03:46.960
So, this gets distributed tonight

03:46.960 --> 03:50.960
to another pair
by the Fortune Holders,

03:50.960 --> 03:54.960
who have, themselves,
just bagged £10,000.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Good luck. Good night. Thank you.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.960
# The night is cold

04:00.960 --> 04:03.960
# The hole's been dug... #

04:03.960 --> 04:08.320
I wonder whether Cherish and Jae can
feel totally comfortable... Yeah.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.960
..with the rationale
behind the decision.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.960
I do wonder why
they got it in for us.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.960
Cherish, what the...?

04:17.960 --> 04:19.960
Let's go.
Let's get home.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
Cherish, I don't know what to...
I don't know what to do.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.480
Cherish, I don't know what to do.
JAE GIGGLES

04:26.480 --> 04:27.960
Cherish, I don't know what to do!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
'We played our game
with a straight bat.'

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
We wouldn't have done it
any other way,

04:30.960 --> 04:33.960
and I'm really pleased that we can
walk away with our heads held high.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.160
CHERISH LAUGHS
Wow.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.960
Us being wrong
that it was Dan and Claire

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
that gave us the Early Checkout Card

04:50.960 --> 04:54.960
is, like, admittedly
not a good thing.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.960
'But they were everyone's
strongest competitors.'

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
Will and Jo.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.320
They're getting
that Early Checkout Card. Fake!

05:03.320 --> 05:05.960
They are getting
that Early Checkout Card. So fake!

05:05.960 --> 05:09.960
That was absolutely... horrendous.

05:09.960 --> 05:14.480
Cherish looked absolutely...

05:14.480 --> 05:15.960
furious.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.320
You know, like, if that were me now,
the trust has gone.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.640
Mm, yeah.
That's it.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.960
We've done it now.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.960
So, that's an enemy
that we've created.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.960
Wow, Will and Jo,

05:28.960 --> 05:31.960
if it really was you, wow.
It was them, Cherish.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.960
In this game,
the way you've played it -

05:36.960 --> 05:38.000
I'm sorry, you're now my enemy.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.160
If it gets out from Jae and Cherish

05:45.160 --> 05:48.960
that we gave them
the Early Checkout Card,

05:48.960 --> 05:51.960
we're gonna look like
a pair of evil baddies.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.960
KNOCKING

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
We need to let them know, Will.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.640
We take the money home by staying
in the competition longer.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.640
We can stay
in the competition longer

06:08.640 --> 06:10.960
by not telling Jae and Cherish
about Michael and Adam.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.960
You are stronger
in this competition together.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.960
'If we break that alliance
with them, throw them under the bus,

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
'they wouldn't look after us
any more.'

06:19.960 --> 06:20.960
If we go home, we go home,

06:20.960 --> 06:23.960
but that, at the minute,
that's sending us home anyway. Will.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
# Let me tell you

06:30.960 --> 06:33.480
# Girl, you my lil boo thang

06:33.480 --> 06:35.000
# So I don't give a hoot
What your dude say

06:35.000 --> 06:37.960
# Girl, I know
You a lil too tame... #

06:37.960 --> 06:39.800
Good morning, best friend.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.960
Ooh, to you, too.
I'm loving the hair.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.960
Morning, morning.
How you feeling?

06:43.960 --> 06:48.960
In terms of where's the money
and where's the Early Checkout Card,

06:48.960 --> 06:52.960
do we want to start taking
a wee bit more of a risk?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.960
We've been Fortune Hunters
since day one,

06:54.960 --> 06:58.960
so we're just still out to...
to catch it.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.960
But, you know, we're bound to
get lucky at some point, Susan.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.960
That was a true blessing.
That was a true blessing.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
That was a true blessing.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.480
It was just like it just... Bong!
Oop, here you go.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.960
I actually slept better than
I thought I would, but...

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
Did you? I didn't.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Did you not sleep at all?
No.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
I want to tell Jae and Cherish

07:17.960 --> 07:19.960
it wasn't us
that gave them the card.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.960
'We've woken up a bit worried
about what happened last night.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.960
'How it sort of unfolded,
especially with Will and Jo-Anne.'

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
We just don't know what's happened.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
Have they been given
the Early Checkout Card?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
I suppose we're gonna find out.
Yeah.

07:32.960 --> 07:33.960
If they are honest with them,

07:33.960 --> 07:35.960
that is breaking an alliance
with us. Yeah.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.960
And we wouldn't do that.
Nah.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.960
You know, once that trust is broken
with us, it is done, innit? Yeah.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.960
Knowing that, OK...
You tried to get rid of us.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.960
..you tried to get rid of us. Ha.
Mm.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.960
And for what reason?
What was the reason?

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
WHISPERS: What was the reason?

07:49.960 --> 07:53.960
My gut instincts have been right
every time when I've done something.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.960
But, Mum, I've made
most of the choices

07:55.960 --> 07:58.640
while we've been here,
and I'm... and we're still here.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.960
We're just gonna go round
in circles,

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
so let's go down to breakfast,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.160
see if we can chat
to Michael and Adam,

08:04.160 --> 08:05.960
and then see
what they've got to say.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.960
Morning.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.640
Good morning. How we doing?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.960
Oh, that's nice,
I'm sat right in a breeze.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
You all right?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.960
You're not pissed off with us,
are you?

08:30.960 --> 08:33.960
Nothing to do with you, was it?
No, I know, but I'm just saying.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
It's just worked out that way.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
I just don't know what to do now.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.960
They think we gave it 'em.
They're devastated.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.960
Everyone here has
their poker face on.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.960
I can't read anything.
That's the problem.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.800
See, this is where I think

08:47.800 --> 08:49.960
you're going to excel
with your hearing impairment.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.960
You can read lips.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.960
Kind of hard,
I can't read across that far.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
They're talking to Aysha,
it's kind of like...

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
JEN MUMBLES
Yeah.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.960
I lost my hearing
when I was 13 years old. One-three.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.960
It just happened all of a sudden.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.960
I woke up the next day,
and I couldn't hear.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.480
It's made me the person that I am.
Yeah.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.000
So, staying positive,
it would really help.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.960
I mean, positive mind always wins.
Yeah.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.960
I believe that. 100%

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
As a quadruple...
CHERISH CHUCKLES

09:18.960 --> 09:21.320
..now, we need to create
an alliance.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.960
Like, me and Tommy both agree,
like, we're closest with you guys.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.960
Curious, like, where you think
the money might be.

09:33.640 --> 09:37.960
What will you do
if Jae and Cherish ask you...

09:38.960 --> 09:40.960
..why you gave them
the Early Checkout Card?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960
I don't know.
Say you pulled it out of a hat.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
Say I pulled it out of a hat?
Yeah.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
SILLY ACCENT: Stick to the plan.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.960
Hi, guys.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.960
Sorry to interrupt
your conversation.

09:51.960 --> 09:52.960
Can we go for a chat?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
WILL: We can.
Yeah.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
'I know I'm gonna have to
lie to them.'

09:58.960 --> 10:00.960
We need to do it
to be able to move forward.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.960
And there's absolutely no malice
or intent in it, is there? No.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
How are you guys doing today?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
Shit.
It's shocking, really.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.160
It's been a bit
of an elephant in the room.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.960
We had the Early Checkout Card
to give out.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
We couldn't think
of a fair way to do it at all.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
We literally just put names
in a hat.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.960
OK.
And... And it was you two.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.960
'I know it was a lie,
and I'm sorry.'

10:30.960 --> 10:33.160
It is really, really difficult.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.960
'But we're saving us skin,
I suppose, aren't we?'

10:37.960 --> 10:39.960
And then like I came down
for breakfast this morning.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.160
You couldn't even talk to me,
and I just thought, "Oh, my God."

10:44.160 --> 10:47.320
Really wanted to understand why.
We were asking ourselves, "Why?"

10:47.320 --> 10:48.960
We actually respect your decision

10:48.960 --> 10:50.960
because, if we were put
in that position,

10:50.960 --> 10:53.960
we probably would have had to
resort to doing the same thing

10:53.960 --> 10:55.960
because we completely understand

10:55.960 --> 10:57.960
that it's, like, hard
to choose someone at this stage.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.000
At least
you're five grand each richer.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.960
You guys.
You, too.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.960
BOTH: No, we're not.
Why?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.800
We didn't keep it.
Why?

11:06.960 --> 11:08.960
Shit.
Shit, we should have had it.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.000
We're in a shit position.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.960
Just got to get ourselves out of it,
that's it.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.960
But we've got to do it tactically.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.320
At least
you're five grand each richer.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.480
You, too.
You guys.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.960
No, we're not.
No.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.960
Why?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.960
Shit. Shit, we should have had it
because...

11:36.960 --> 11:38.480
Shit.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.960
Then it just all went silent.
It went silent.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
It felt like
that probably took three seconds,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.800
but it felt like a minute.
Yeah.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.960
Yeah, but you guys had it
last night, no?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.960
Listen to what I'm saying.
We're gonna play dumb.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.960
So who had it?
It totally baffles me.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
This is where I get stuck.
I'm totally baffled.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.000
Right.
We had it in our possession

12:01.000 --> 12:03.960
when the ten-grand rule
wasn't a thing.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.960
Unless my calculations are wrong.
No, it's not, it's not.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.480
It doesn't make sense, like...
It's not.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.960
And don't get me wrong,
I still respect that lie. Yeah.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.960
Because we are still playing a game.
Yeah.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.000
Well, either way...

12:18.000 --> 12:21.960
I feel like, erm,
now we have closure.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.320
I'm sorry we gave you
the Early Checkout Card.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.960
Obviously, you understand why.
Yeah.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.960
'100% don't trust Will and Jo.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.960
'I think that Michael and Adam
are another fake couple.'

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
We don't know who to trust here.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
Can we hug it out?
Yeah. We can hug it out.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.960
Course we can, man.
My God, yeah.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.640
Morning.
Morning.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.480
How you all doing?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.960
Sleeping well?
Are you tossing and turning?

12:53.960 --> 12:57.160
No, I had a dream that a briefcase
was chasing me with teeth.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.960
No! I don't know if we...
how we can analyse that.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.960
I don't know what that means.
She had too much cheese last thing.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.960
Right, well, it's almost time
for today's Room Service Challenge.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.960
I do hope you've all remembered
to bring your easels.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
I'm shit at art.
STEPHEN LAUGHS

13:12.960 --> 13:15.320
We're halfway through this holiday,

13:15.320 --> 13:18.800
and, you know, at The Fortune Hotel,
we like to mix things up.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.960
So, the winners
of today's Room Service Challenge

13:21.960 --> 13:23.960
will get to make a secret swap

13:23.960 --> 13:27.640
or take a secret peek
at another pair's case

13:27.640 --> 13:28.960
and remain anonymous.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.960
This could put the winners
in quite a powerful position.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.960
I wish you all good luck.

13:33.960 --> 13:34.960
Off you go.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.960
MUSIC: 'Vogue'
by Madonna

13:38.640 --> 13:39.960
If we don't do well,

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
we've got to hope
that Adam and Michael do well.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.800
Yeah, hopefully, we do win
this Room Service Challenge

13:44.800 --> 13:47.480
because it'll be
the best way to swap cases back.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.800
No-one will have a clue.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.960
There's a lot more pressure
right now.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.320
The ideal situation would be
for us to win this challenge

13:56.320 --> 13:57.960
so we can keep the fortune.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.960
"Jack, I want you to paint me
like one of your French girls."

14:01.960 --> 14:03.960
MIKE LAUGHS
# Strike a pose... #

14:03.960 --> 14:05.960
The Fortune Hotel
has a whole range

14:05.960 --> 14:08.960
of complementary stationery
available in every room,

14:08.960 --> 14:12.160
which is perfect
if you wanna plan the day, or...

14:12.160 --> 14:15.960
or even maybe do a little doodle.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.960
I mean, it's not finished,
but, you know, you get the idea.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.960
JAE LAUGHS
That's good. How's he done that?

14:21.960 --> 14:24.960
Ha, Stephen, you didn't do that.
LAUGHS

14:24.960 --> 14:28.960
Today, you'll be drawing a pair
of your fellow guests.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.640
"You have ten minutes to create
your best work of art."

14:32.640 --> 14:33.960
"You will be drawing..."

14:33.960 --> 14:34.960
"Tommy and Scott."

14:34.960 --> 14:36.960
That's a good one.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.960
"Aysha and Samm." Oh!

14:38.960 --> 14:41.960
"Michael and Adam."
Wow.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
"Jen and Susan."

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
"Jo-Anne and Will."
LAUGHS

14:44.960 --> 14:47.320
"Cherish and Jae."
I had them in my head.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.960
Time starts now.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.960
Go on, then.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.000
So I'll do Scott.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.960
The smile needs to be big enough.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.160
Cherish's head.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.960
Are you serious?

14:56.960 --> 14:57.960
I'm drawing Jen.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.160
Yeah, that's all right, you know.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.960
# Tick, tick, boom... #

15:00.960 --> 15:01.960
What is that?!
That's his nose.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
Is that his hands?
That's his nose.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.960
I tried to draw the teeth.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.960
She looked like
she'd had half of them knocked out.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.960
SHE LAUGHS

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
Oh, my God, she's gonna be fuming.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.960
THEY LAUGH

15:14.960 --> 15:16.960
That could be anybody!

15:16.960 --> 15:17.960
Come on!
Sorry.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.160
It's time.
I know.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.960
I think that looks like Samm.

15:21.960 --> 15:22.960
Really?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.960
You're doing Susan.
That looks more like Michael.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.320
LAUGHTER.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.960
What is that?

15:29.960 --> 15:32.960
That's the plant pot he did a poo...
LAUGHTER

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
Don't draw a poo.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
You're drawing a poo.
I'm drawing a wee poo.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.960
Guys, I hope you appreciate
the effort.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
I'm sitting here,
trying to polish a turd right now.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
DING
Five minutes left. OK.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.960
Just finish his hands off.
What's wrong with his hands?

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
Well, he hasn't got any
at the moment.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
LAUGHTER

15:51.960 --> 15:54.640
Make the ears bigger?
That's a caricature.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.000
Bigger features.
Bigger features?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.960
He's got a bigger chin
than Jimmy Hill. Mike! Mike!

15:59.960 --> 16:00.960
DING

16:00.960 --> 16:02.640
You've got one minute.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.320
Susan told us that
her best feature is her bum,

16:05.320 --> 16:07.960
so Tommy drew a massive derriere.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.960
Clearly retained nothing
from art lessons.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
DING
Ten seconds. That's ten seconds.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.960
LAUGHTER

16:14.960 --> 16:15.960
Good, mate. I like it.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.960
Not bad, isn't it?

16:18.960 --> 16:21.960
I feel bad, because they were
supposed to look really nice.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.960
Handsome pair of buggers,
aren't they?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.960
GONG CRASH

16:26.960 --> 16:29.320
LAUGHTER

16:29.320 --> 16:32.960
Cherish, I want to see how
they're gonna draw us. I know!

16:32.960 --> 16:36.320
"The pair that get the most votes
will win this challenge."

16:36.320 --> 16:39.960
"Enjoy the Fortune Hotel
art gallery."

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
I'm gassed for this, are you?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
That's me and you.
LAUGHTER

16:45.960 --> 16:47.800
Look at your leg.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.960
Looks like a pirate.
It does, doesn't it?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
What's on your feet?

16:51.960 --> 16:53.960
Oh, there's the plant pot,
look, with shit.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.960
THEY LAUGH

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
I think we may have to
absolutely bluff that

16:56.960 --> 16:59.960
and pass that off as,
"Who drew Mike and Adam?"

16:59.960 --> 17:00.960
THEY LAUGH

17:00.960 --> 17:03.960
Aysha and Samm. Oh, my God.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.800
HE LAUGHS

17:05.800 --> 17:06.960
They drew me in a granny skirt.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.960
That's pretty decent.

17:10.960 --> 17:11.960
That's really good.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.960
Oh, I love that.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.320
LAUGHTER

17:19.960 --> 17:23.960
You people are wicked!
You people are wicked.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
That's so good, you know.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.960
Susan!

17:30.960 --> 17:32.960
That's my bum at the back!

17:34.960 --> 17:37.960
Oh, my God, this is the worst.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.800
Yeah. We can never tell them
that we drew that.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.960
The pair of them
are gonna want to eat us alive.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.640
I look like Lee Evans.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.960
Whoever has drawn Susan and Jen,

17:46.960 --> 17:48.960
they're gonna have to get
an armed bodyguard

17:48.960 --> 17:50.960
when they find out who it is.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.960
"Vote for your favourite now."

17:53.960 --> 17:56.960
It's between Tommy and Scott's
and Jo-Anne and Will's for me.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.000
So, our tactic in this is we don't
want to pick the obvious ones

18:01.000 --> 18:03.960
because we wanna win and
we think our drawing's up there.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.960
Yeah. So we're gonna go with
one of the worst.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
PHONE RINGS

18:27.960 --> 18:29.960
Hi. Is that Adam?

18:29.960 --> 18:31.960
'It's Stephen.'
Hi, Stephen. How are you?

18:31.960 --> 18:34.960
I'm good. You won the Challenge.
Oh, lovely.

18:34.960 --> 18:39.640
'You get to secretly swap a case
with another pair, or have a peek.'

18:39.640 --> 18:42.160
Have a chat with
your fellow Leonardo da Vinci.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.960
CHUCKLES

18:43.960 --> 18:45.000
And I wish you very good luck.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.960
Thank you very much, Stephen.
Well done.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
'Cheers. Thank you. Bye.'
Bye.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.960
"Please place your case
outside your door now."

19:01.640 --> 19:02.960
We'll take the money.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.960
Swap with Cherish and Jae, yeah?
Lock that in.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
Lock it in mate, well done, mate.
Well done.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
Why are you so upset?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.960
Cherish, I'm upset
because we had the money

19:14.960 --> 19:16.960
and we have probably lost it.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.000
OK, and we always knew that
that wasn't in our control.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.960
Let's not do that. Don't do that.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
Don't ask me why I'm so upset.
That's not fair.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.960
Jae, this is what I can't take,
though.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.480
Told you already,
we don't know how today's gonna go.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.960
You can't let these things
get to you like this.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
"Please collect your cases."

19:53.960 --> 19:55.960
Fuckin' hell.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.960
Michael and Adam
could have potentially

20:03.960 --> 20:05.960
taken the fortune from us.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.960
We were directly targeted,

20:07.960 --> 20:10.960
and I feel like you wouldn't be
so confident to swap

20:10.960 --> 20:13.960
unless you really, really knew.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.960
MICHAEL: Got the money bag, baby!

20:18.800 --> 20:20.000
Phew!

20:21.960 --> 20:23.320
Get in there!

20:24.960 --> 20:26.320
That doesn't mean anything, though.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.960
It's still Lady Luck
that's the decider.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.960
How was the Room Service Challenge?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.960
Yeah, it was all right, weren't it?
Funny.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.960
Did you win?
We sealed the deal, yeah.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.960
What did you do?
What do you think we done?

20:47.960 --> 20:49.800
Took the money?
Yeah.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.960
They're there.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.960
Oh, are they?
Yeah.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
Do you think anyone has built
an alliance? Have you seen any?

20:56.960 --> 21:00.960
Will and Jo-Anne and
Adam and Michael are very tight.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.960
I'm sure most of you guys
have seen that as well.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.960
They always have each other's backs.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.960
Do you reckon anyone else in here is
sharing the information like we do?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.960
Tommy and Scott.
And Jae and Cherish.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.960
If we could possibly
take out a pair,

21:14.960 --> 21:18.480
it would be either Jae and Cherish
or Tommy and Scott.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.960
If we take one of them out
later on...

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
Their alliance is gone then,
isn't it?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.960
Their alliance has gone,
and we're only going stronger.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.960
At the moment, Cherish and Jae
have just got eyes on us

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
and it's not good, is it?
Not good at all.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.960
Would you be prepared to dink...
to get rid of Jae and Cherish?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
Yes.
Yes.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.960
Ugh, give you shivers, saying that.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.960
If we have an opportunity
to give you the money back,

21:42.960 --> 21:44.960
we will, won't we?
Yeah.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.960
To reciprocate
what you've done to us.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.800
Yeah.
I think that's the plan.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.960
STEPHEN: Ah, hello.
Guests of The Fortune Hotel,

21:51.960 --> 21:54.640
it's almost time
for your Day Trip Challenge.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.000
To win this challenge, you're gonna
need to cut through the static

21:58.000 --> 22:00.960
and communicate.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.960
See you there. Over and out.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.960
Over and out gives me...

22:05.960 --> 22:08.320
Radios. ..radios,
walkie-talkies, communications.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.960
It might be a team thing.
Yeah, could be.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.960
# There's blood on the ground... #

22:17.800 --> 22:19.960
Whoever's won
the Room Service Challenge,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
they're probably gonna swap,

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
because we said if we'd done that,
we'd just go for it,

22:23.960 --> 22:25.960
cos we've got nothing in ours,
know what I mean?

22:25.960 --> 22:27.960
I feel like we've got
a mutual understanding. We do.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.960
But there's always that
little element of doubt

22:29.960 --> 22:31.960
that I'm sure that you both feel.
Yeah.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
We ain't got a clue
where anything is.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.320
We need to put ourselves
in a position

22:35.320 --> 22:37.960
where we can't be got at,
really, don't we?

22:37.960 --> 22:40.960
Michael and Adam,
what they've just told us,

22:40.960 --> 22:44.480
I'm starting to consider that
they are the Fortune Holders. Yeah.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.160
We've got the dreaded
Early Checkout Card,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.000
so there's a lot of pressure on us.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.960
If we come last...

22:53.960 --> 22:55.960
Big problem.
Big problem.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.960
# There's blood on the throne. #

23:01.320 --> 23:05.960
# Take on me... #

23:05.960 --> 23:08.960
CHERISH: We are at risk of receiving
the Early Checkout Card

23:08.960 --> 23:10.960
from Will and Jo tonight.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.960
We're gonna win. We have to win.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.800
WILL: We've said it
since we got given the card.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.960
Tensions are high.
We know we've got to do well.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.960
Doing well in the challenge
is all that matters.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.960
Hello, and welcome
to the Tower Estate.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.960
Today is all about cooperation.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.960
Play well today,
and you will be one step closer

23:35.960 --> 23:38.480
to walking away with the fortune.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.960
You are going to be split
into three teams.

23:41.960 --> 23:42.960
Jo-Anne and Will,

23:42.960 --> 23:45.960
you'll be playing
with Tommy and Scott. Solid.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.960
Susan and Jen, you are playing
with Aysha and Samm.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.960
Michael and Adam
with Cherish and Jae.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.960
Here's how today's challenge
is gonna work.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.960
It's going to be
a good old-fashioned hunt.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.960
One pair is going to be
inside the house with the map.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.000
These are the Guiders.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.480
The remaining team
are going to be in the grounds.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.960
They are the Seekers.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
The Guiders have to use
their walkie-talkies...

24:13.960 --> 24:15.160
'Over and out.'

24:15.160 --> 24:18.960
..to guide the Seekers
to three locations on the map.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.960
They are looking for a picture tile

24:22.960 --> 24:24.480
like this.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.960
The first team
to find their three unique tiles

24:30.960 --> 24:33.960
and then meet back at the house
will be the winning team.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.960
I wish you all good fortune.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.000
Your challenge starts now.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.960
ALL SHOUT

24:43.960 --> 24:45.800
Got the... Got the radio. Over.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.960
OK, we're just looking
for where we are.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.480
It's not just communications

24:50.480 --> 24:51.960
between the pairs here
and out there.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.960
Walk back down to the tower
and past the little house.

24:55.960 --> 25:00.800
Find a cobbled stone path
in front of some bamboo beds, OK?

25:00.800 --> 25:01.960
Bamboo beds. Bamboo bed.
Yeah.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.640
Got to communicate out there, too,
because only one of the team...

25:05.640 --> 25:07.960
Can you see rabbits and goats?
Over.

25:07.960 --> 25:08.960
..has the sound in their ear.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.960
Pinky, I need more info
cos I'm just blinded.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.960
We can see rabbits and goats. Over.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.960
'There's one there.'

25:19.960 --> 25:22.640
Around where the goats are,
they said, it should be this side.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.960
Urgh!
Fucking hell.

25:23.960 --> 25:27.960
I hope the one thing they don't find
is the 800lb silverback

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
that lives in these grounds,
called Tito

25:29.960 --> 25:33.480
cos he's been known...
to eat people's faces off.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.960
'We're at Mysterious Mangrove.
Can you see that on the map?'

25:37.960 --> 25:40.960
Towards the creaking bamboo,

25:40.960 --> 25:43.800
there should be one
on your right-hand side.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.960
It's in here, Mum. It's in here.
Right, OK.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.960
I found it, I found it, got it.
It's a pink flamingo. Over.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.160
Yeah, we've got it, boys. Over.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.960
We've got the first one,
we're thinking, "Right..."

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Where's the next?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.000
Let's go find it.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.640
Is it on the right-hand side
or the left-hand side?

25:59.640 --> 26:01.960
You should be going past
a little red hut.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
There's no red hut.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.480
'It was getting
a little bit frustrating.'

26:04.480 --> 26:07.640
We don't know where they are,
we can't tell them where to go.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.960
Communication is key
in this challenge. 100%.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
There's a tile on the lover's bench.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.960
Oh, seen the tile. It's a monkey.
It's a brown monkey.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.960
Excellent.
Monkey.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
Very nice. Well done.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.960
Two found.
One team is yet to find a tile.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
Still stuck on this first one, man.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
Mate, this is shocking.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.480
Maybe go a bit deeper into the green
on your right-hand side.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.640
CHERISH:
Gonna go to the Secret Garden.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.640
Yeah. Secret Garden.
We're here, we're here.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.960
Cherish, she's good.
It's like an air traffic controller,

26:38.960 --> 26:41.960
if the planes were
slightly sunburnt contestants.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.960
'The cross is at the second tree.'

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
Yeah. Got it, got it. OK.
What is it?

26:46.960 --> 26:47.960
It's a crab.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.960
Right, girls, we have found
the second tile, it is a crab.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.960
Mate, we are flying.
We are absolutely flying, mate.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.960
Good work, guys. Good work.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.960
They're too busy to talk to me.
That's OK.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.320
HE SIGHS

26:58.320 --> 27:00.960
'It's a bamboo path.'

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
Cherish and Jae's team
have found two.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.960
Susan and Jen's team have found one.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.960
Tommy and Scott, nothing.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.960
It's not looking great.
It's not looking good.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.960
We have to get a tile.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.960
Losing is the worst-case scenario.
As simple as that.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.800
Come on, man, I don't know.
This isn't looking good.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.960
JO: High. Look high, Will.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.960
I'll look low, you look high,
and then we'll swap.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.320
They're obviously gonna
get stressed out, out there,

27:38.320 --> 27:39.960
and we're getting stressed in here.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.480
Cherish and Jae's team
have found two,

27:42.480 --> 27:44.160
Susan and Jen's team found one.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.960
Jo-Anne and Will
yet to find a tile.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.960
Tommy and Scott
will need to pull their finger out.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.480
I've got it!
Beautiful. What's it look like?

27:52.480 --> 27:54.960
It's a watermelon.
Right, we're coming back through

27:54.960 --> 27:56.960
and we're gonna end up
in the middle.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.960
So, directions from the middle.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
You're gonna go up those stairs,

28:01.960 --> 28:03.960
and the second cross is there,
it's a bamboo path.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.960
Girls, is it in the flower beds
of the bam... bamboo?

28:06.960 --> 28:07.960
'It's in the bushes.'

28:07.960 --> 28:09.960
I found it,
I found it, it's like a coconut.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.960
Excellent,
you guys are doing amazing.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.960
Really well done. I want you to go
to the Secret Garden.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.960
Are we in the...
Is this the Grill here?

28:19.960 --> 28:21.960
There should be a little green
on your right-hand side,

28:21.960 --> 28:23.960
opposite the Garden Grill.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.960
Will!
You got one?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.960
Will! I've got it, it's a ram.
It's a ram.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.960
Lovely stuff, mate. Lovely stuff.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.960
It is there.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.960
Right, well,
they're saying it's here.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.960
STEPHEN: Will and Jo
and Scott and Tommy have caught up.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.960
It's neck and neck.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.640
This is getting very tense.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.960
This is very frustrating

28:41.960 --> 28:45.960
because we were so quick
getting the first two.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.160
We want to put ourselves
in a good position

28:47.160 --> 28:49.960
going into that Lady Luck Bar
tonight. Time is ticking,

28:49.960 --> 28:51.000
and we are not getting anywhere.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.960
What we saying? I'm listening,
I'm can't talk and listen!

28:53.960 --> 28:56.960
'You're not telling me anything.'
Can you see the stairs again?

28:56.960 --> 28:58.960
Don't fucking talk to me
when they're talking to me!

28:58.960 --> 28:59.960
You need to tell me stuff.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.960
You're snapping away like a little
Jack Russell and I can't hear.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.960
You have to tell me something,

29:03.960 --> 29:06.000
instead of just going, "Yep,"
and then walk off.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.960
Yeah, I've seen the Secret Garden.
I'm here.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
When they're telling me,
you're fucking speaking.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.480
You're telling me fuck all.
I can't see us finding it.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.960
And I'm starting to panic, mate.
I am starting to panic.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.160
On the top right corner,
there should be a tile.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.960
I've got it, Will, I've got it.
We've got it.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.960
Lovely stuff. What is it?
And then make your way back.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.960
It's an iguana.
We're on our way back now.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.800
'Mum, come on, we need to be quick.'

29:28.800 --> 29:30.960
Copy, I've seen it, it's a fish.
I've seen it.

29:30.960 --> 29:31.960
'We are done.'

29:33.160 --> 29:34.800
SHE GRUNTS

29:34.800 --> 29:36.960
STEPHEN: Two teams have found
all the tiles,

29:36.960 --> 29:38.960
but who will be first back?

29:38.960 --> 29:40.960
We're getting quite tense.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.320
Come on!
Mum, come on. Mum, come on, rapid.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.960
SHE YELLS

29:46.960 --> 29:49.960
HEARTBEATS

29:49.960 --> 29:51.800
Are we the first ones?

29:51.800 --> 29:53.960
Yeah, we're the first ones.
We're the fucking first ones!

29:53.960 --> 29:55.960
THEY CHEER

29:57.960 --> 30:00.000
First win. Feels amazing.
Amazing. It feels so good.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.640
Pretty buzzing
that we've won the challenge

30:04.640 --> 30:07.960
cos we know we're safe.
It was exhilarating.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.960
We were ten seconds behind.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.000
Disappointed, of course.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.960
Yeah. We were so close
to getting that one.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.000
We are last.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.960
We're last. We're last.
'So you just need to come back.'

30:18.960 --> 30:21.320
We're last.
Fucking hell!

30:23.960 --> 30:25.960
STEPHEN: Well done. That was tense.

30:26.960 --> 30:30.960
Some of it was less walkie-talkie,
more runny-shouty, wasn't it?

30:30.960 --> 30:33.960
Stressful. Especially well done
to the four of you -

30:33.960 --> 30:35.960
Jo-Anne, Will, Tommy and Scott.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.960
Both pairs are going to be rewarded.

30:38.960 --> 30:44.960
One pair is going to get
that coveted final swap tonight.

30:44.960 --> 30:48.960
The other pair is going to decide

30:48.960 --> 30:51.800
the entire rest
of the swapping order.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.960
That's for you four
to decide between yourselves.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.960
Don't tell us until the Nightcap.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.160
It's time to go back
to The Fortune Hotel.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.960
And tonight, the Fortune Holders
will be checking their bank balance

31:02.960 --> 31:05.960
and the Unfortunates
will be checking out.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.960
See you later.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.960
THUNDER BOOMS

31:16.800 --> 31:18.960
WILL: Suppose we need to get
to business now, then?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.960
Yeah, me and Tommy said

31:20.960 --> 31:22.960
the last thing we wanna do
is pick people.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.960
You're last pick, then, boys.
Thank you.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.640
We've now got to pick the order
of the swap-ins,

31:29.640 --> 31:32.960
which is working
in our favour, really,

31:32.960 --> 31:35.960
because we can manipulate
the game tonight.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.960
Hopefully, they put us in
decent positions, don't they? Yeah.

31:41.960 --> 31:42.960
I don't think they will.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
And I only say that
because, out of fairness,

31:44.960 --> 31:48.960
we technically are the team
that came last.

31:48.960 --> 31:52.960
TOMMY: Number one, number one!

31:52.960 --> 31:54.640
Yeah!

31:54.640 --> 31:57.960
We don't even have to do nothing
and we're here tomorrow.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
All that matters
is getting rid of this.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.960
We'll definitely get rid of that,
won't we? Yeah.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
If we play it right,
we can get rid of that

32:06.960 --> 32:09.960
and get the money back
and have ten grand tonight.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.800
Obviously, it's not
an easy decision to make

32:13.800 --> 32:14.960
because we've got relationships

32:14.960 --> 32:16.960
with pretty much everyone
in there now.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.960
Michael and Adam, we want them
to give their money case

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
to Jae and Cherish
so we can take Jae and Cherish out,

32:22.960 --> 32:25.960
and they want to get
Jae and Cherish out, too.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.960
I'll give him a little nod
in the Lady Luck Bar to do it.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.960
Just leave it to me tonight.
I know what I'm doing.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.960
# Save tonight

32:38.960 --> 32:41.960
# And fight the break of dawn

32:41.960 --> 32:44.960
# Come tomorrow... #

32:44.960 --> 32:46.960
ADAM: At the moment,
we know where the money is

32:46.960 --> 32:48.320
and we know where
the Early Checkout Card is,

32:48.320 --> 32:49.960
but anything can change.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.960
# Fight the break of dawn... #

32:52.960 --> 32:54.960
JEN: You need to wait
to see your opponent's move

32:54.960 --> 32:56.320
before you make your move.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.640
SUSAN: Do we take the risk
and do a swap?

33:02.960 --> 33:05.960
SAMM: Someone else gets to choose
the order of the ranking.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.960
AYSHA: All we can do
is have our fingers crossed.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.960
CHERISH: We're both vulnerable
and at risk

33:12.960 --> 33:16.160
of receiving the Early Checkout Card
from Will and Jo tonight.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.960
JAE: We're going to be
easily targeted.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.960
Guests of The Fortune Hotel,
good evening.

33:23.960 --> 33:24.960
Welcome to the Nightcap.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.640
Delighted to see
you all made it here tonight

33:27.640 --> 33:29.960
without someone shouting directions
in your ear.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.960
So, as we discussed at the end
of the Day Trip Challenge,

33:34.960 --> 33:36.960
the winning team
get to choose one pair.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.960
Well, they'll be the last people
to decide whether to swap or stick,

33:39.960 --> 33:42.960
and the other pair
are going to decide the entire rest

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
of the swapping order.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.960
Tommy and Scott, Jo-Anne and Will,
what have you decided?

33:47.960 --> 33:50.960
They're gonna be taking
the last pick tonight,

33:50.960 --> 33:51.960
and we've decided the order.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.960
Which means a lot of power
in your hands.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.640
We've just done it
the fairest way we could.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.960
It's nothing with any malice.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.800
Jo-Anne and Will,
if you could tell us

34:02.800 --> 34:05.480
who's gonna be making that first
compulsory swap this evening

34:05.480 --> 34:06.960
and why you've chosen them.

34:10.960 --> 34:15.960
The reason we've chose this couple
is because these are the only couple

34:15.960 --> 34:17.960
that have mentioned
feeling homesick.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.960
So for that reason,
the last pick is Cherish and Jae.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.960
CHERISH:
'That's gameplay right there.'

34:23.960 --> 34:25.960
It's not a shock.
It's not shocking.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.640
I knew that was gonna happen.

34:27.640 --> 34:31.960
Cherish and Jae, you're first up,
you have to swap.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
Who are you gonna swap with?
We kind of expected that.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.960
We're gonna swap with a couple

34:36.960 --> 34:39.960
because they have kept their case
most of the time.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
We'd be safe, too.

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
That's Susan and Jen.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.800
Are you looking for the money?
CHERISH AND JAE: No.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.960
Playing a long game, Stephen.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.960
OK, thank you. Please swap.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.960
WHISPERS: Thank you.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.960
OK, Jo-Anne and Will, who's next?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
The reason we've picked
the next couple,

35:02.960 --> 35:04.960
we can't look past the fact
that you have come last

35:04.960 --> 35:06.960
in the last two challenges,
and it'd be unfair on everyone else

35:06.960 --> 35:09.960
if I wasn't to pick
Adam and Michael to go next.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.960
Take it on the chin,

35:15.960 --> 35:17.960
we didn't do very well today,
so it's fair enough.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.960
Me and Adam are giving regular looks
to each other across the bar,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.960
just giving each other a nod
of reassurance and a bit of a wink.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.960
'Just basically saying to each other
"it's gonna be all right".'

35:27.960 --> 35:29.160
It's a good move
from Will and Jo-Anne,

35:29.160 --> 35:31.960
because we haven't done well
in the last two challenges,

35:31.960 --> 35:32.960
and putting it across like that

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
is a very believable story
to everyone, isn't it?

35:34.960 --> 35:37.960
OK. Michael and Adam,
what would you like to do?

35:37.960 --> 35:41.480
I think we was always gonna swap.
We're following a particular case.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.000
The reason we are is because
we want to trust this pair,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.960
and we need to know what's inside
the case to fully trust them.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.480
We need to get this money
back into the pot,

35:50.480 --> 35:52.480
so it gives Will and Jo

35:52.480 --> 35:54.160
the opportunity to take it back,
doesn't it?

35:56.960 --> 36:00.960
Right, we'll swap
with Cherish and Jae, please.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.960
Cherish and Jae, you're the centre
of a bit of action this evening.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.960
How do you feel about this swap?
We'll have to wait and see.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.000
We feel a little bit vulnerable
and a little bit set up.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.960
'Why are you passing
the briefcase to us?'

36:14.960 --> 36:17.960
Our original plan
is to send Cherish and Jae home.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.960
That's why Michael and Adam
are swapping with Cherish and Jae,

36:21.960 --> 36:25.320
because they're happy for Cherish
and Jae to be going home as well.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.960
Right, Jo-Anne and Will, who's next?

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
The next swap is Susan and Jen.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.960
So, Susan and Jen,
you currently have the case

36:31.960 --> 36:33.960
that originally belonged
to Cherish and Jae.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.000
What are you gonna do
with that case?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.640
We want to fully trust
this other pairing.

36:42.960 --> 36:47.000
Therefore, we are going to swap back
with Cherish and Jae.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.960
Obviously, we know that
that's Mike and Adam's case.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.960
So you're trusting Michael and Adam?
Yeah.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.960
Holy shit, what's happening?

37:09.960 --> 37:12.960
We are going to swap back
with Cherish and Jae.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.320
Jae and Cherish swapped with you?
JEN AND SUSAN: Yeah.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.960
So your case ended up there.
Yeah.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.960
Michael and Adam swapped
with Jae and Cherish,

37:23.960 --> 37:25.960
so your original case
is now over there.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.960
Yeah.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.960
The case that's there is Michael
and Adam's, and you want it?

37:29.960 --> 37:32.960
We need to take a risk
at some point. OK.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.960
Susan and Jen are swapping
with Cherish and Jae.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.960
ADAM: 'That is a shock
and an absolute curveball.'

37:39.960 --> 37:41.960
The pairs in the room
are surely cottoning on

37:41.960 --> 37:43.960
that there's got to be something
in there...

37:43.960 --> 37:46.960
Something in there.
..for this to keep moving like that.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.960
This is a fascinating evening.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.960
The ultimate goal is to be
the Fortune Holder at this point,

37:53.960 --> 37:54.960
at least for one night,

37:54.960 --> 37:57.960
and to be able to withdraw
some money from that case.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
WILL: Aysha, Samm, you're next.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
So, Aysha and Samm,

38:01.960 --> 38:05.960
every single couple
has swapped cases this evening.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.960
What are you gonna do?
So many swaps.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.320
Things seem quite jumbled up,

38:10.320 --> 38:14.000
and... we have no choice but
to stay safe at this point again.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.960
You do have a choice.
We'll stick.

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
OK.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.960
With Tommy and Scott
making the last swap,

38:22.960 --> 38:26.960
that leaves Jo-Anne and Will -
it must be your swap next.

38:28.960 --> 38:29.960
WILL: 'What do we do now?'

38:29.960 --> 38:33.960
Our original plan
is to send Cherish and Jae home.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.320
JO-ANNE: 'This is our opportunity
to get ten grand.'

38:38.960 --> 38:41.960
'Oh, God, I don't know,
it just fries my bloody brain.'

38:43.000 --> 38:45.960
I've got no reason
to not trust any couple in here,

38:45.960 --> 38:48.160
but there's one couple
that I trust 110%...

38:49.960 --> 38:51.960
..and it's Adam and Michael.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.960
We've been following their case
around the room,

38:53.960 --> 38:56.960
and it's ended up
in the hands of Jen and Sue.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
I know Adam and Michael's case
is empty,

39:02.960 --> 39:04.160
so I'm gonna swap with Jen and Sue.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.960
So you're swapping
to get an empty case.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.480
Saves the risk.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.960
Why not stick with what you've got?

39:10.960 --> 39:14.960
I think if we stick,
we then look suspicious.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.960
Do you think Samm and Aysha
look suspicious?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
I do, and I think a lot
of the group think they do.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.000
You've got to understand,
when you stick four times,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.960
it does start to look
a little bit fishy.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.960
So, yeah, we're gonna swap
with Jen and Sue.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.960
Well, Aysha and Samm,
if you do have the money,

39:38.960 --> 39:41.960
you've been making quite a packet
over the last few nights.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.480
I'm surprised they've done that,

39:45.480 --> 39:47.160
because they've taken
a little bit of a risk.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.320
But fair play.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.160
Jo-Anne and Will,
you're swapping with Susan and Jen.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.960
JAE: 'If they really wanted to get
us out, they could have tonight.'

39:56.960 --> 40:00.960
I'm really, really, really confused.
Like, my head is frazzled.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.960
So, Tommy and Scott,
you have that final decision.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.320
It's been quite
an interesting evening,

40:08.320 --> 40:10.960
four swaps and one stick,

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
and one case in particular

40:12.960 --> 40:14.960
seems to have been attracting
a lot of attention.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.960
So, that case is currently
with Jo-Anne and Will.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.000
You do have the final decision
tonight.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.960
You can swap or you can stick.
What would you like to do?

40:26.960 --> 40:29.960
Surely, surely, Tommy and Scott
have cottoned on to this,

40:29.960 --> 40:31.960
and they're gonna take the case,
surely.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.960
Yeah.
We would like to swap with...

40:39.960 --> 40:41.960
..erm...

40:41.960 --> 40:44.320
Samm and Aysha, please.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.960
You wanna swap with Samm and Aysha?
Er, yeah, that one.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.960
It was making me dizzy
at this stage with the amount

40:48.960 --> 40:50.000
it was moving around.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.960
Oh, my goodness, how have they...
how have they missed that?

40:53.960 --> 40:55.960
I just really...
I can't get my head round it.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.960
You weren't tempted
by the pair-hopping case down here?

40:58.960 --> 40:59.960
Yeah.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.960
It's tempting, but we're just trying
to kind of narrow down

41:02.960 --> 41:04.480
so we know exactly where it is.

41:06.960 --> 41:09.960
They're absolute doughnuts and
didn't take the case back off us.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.960
Somebody has
that Early Checkout Card.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.960
And somebody
is gonna be going home tonight.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.480
OK. Please swap, thank you.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.960
It's not personal, mate, sorry.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.960
Right, it's time
to learn your fortunes.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.160
For those of you with new cases,

41:33.160 --> 41:35.960
please come up one by one
to take a look.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.960
Keep an eye out for reactions.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.800
You never know what you might learn.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.960
Right, there we have it.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.960
Obviously, one pair
will be leaving us this evening.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.960
It's time to find out who.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.960
Could the unfortunate pair
please reveal themselves?

42:26.960 --> 42:28.960
Susan and Jen.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.320
So sorry to see you go.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.960
It's the game.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.960
'It's been a hell
of a roller-coaster ride.'

42:37.960 --> 42:41.000
Yeah, we took a risk.
It... It didn't work out.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.960
Please leave your case
and say your goodbyes.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.480
APPLAUSE

42:45.480 --> 42:50.000
# This is the world we live in

42:50.000 --> 42:55.160
# These are the hands we're given

42:55.160 --> 42:59.960
# Use them and let's start trying

42:59.960 --> 43:05.960
# To make it
A place worth living in... #

43:05.960 --> 43:08.960
That almost concludes
our business for this evening.

43:08.960 --> 43:12.480
As usual, this Early Checkout Card
will be delivered

43:12.480 --> 43:16.960
to one of your rooms,
courtesy of the Fortune Holders.

43:16.960 --> 43:21.000
Not only have they made £10,000,
they're also in control of the money

43:21.000 --> 43:23.960
at a very interesting time
in the game.

43:23.960 --> 43:26.160
Well done to you all
for still being here.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.960
Thank you, good night.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.960
JEN CHUCKLES
Aw!

43:34.960 --> 43:37.960
Oh, my God, this is brutal!

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
It doesn't get any easier.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.480
It just gets harder and harder
and harder every time.

43:42.480 --> 43:47.160
The absolute whirlwind
of an adventure that we've just had.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.960
And I'm so glad it was with you.
Me, too.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.640
I wouldn't have done this
with anybody else.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.320
We gave it a good go. Yeah.
Yeah, we have.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.960
We gave it a good go.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.640
Last orders have been called
at the bar, Susan,

43:59.640 --> 44:02.960
so it's time for drink up and leave.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
Yeah.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.640
Oh, what's that? You were players!

44:17.640 --> 44:19.960
JO-ANNE LAUGHS

44:19.960 --> 44:22.960
If we go out tomorrow,
we're going home ten grand richer.

44:24.960 --> 44:28.960
So, we've got this to give away.
Adam and Mike are no-go.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.960
JO-ANNE: Tommy and Scott,
they're very consistent,

44:33.960 --> 44:34.960
aren't they, with what they do?

44:34.960 --> 44:37.960
And two to watch.
Yeah, definitely.

44:37.960 --> 44:38.960
I don't think it will come to us.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.960
I think everyone knows
that's a big risk.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.000
Aysha and Samm, I think
they've been coasting through,

44:44.000 --> 44:45.960
and they've been playing
very, very safe.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.960
They haven't really played
the game yet.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.960
Will and Jo are the centre
of this conspiracy.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.160
Do we wanna be against them
in the final? Not really.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.480
Yeah, it's gonna be
a tough choice, innit?

45:04.160 --> 45:08.960
Now it's five last couples,
we squash that alliance.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.960
I feel like it's gonna be a battle
of the alliances

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
between Cherish and Jae's alliance
with Tommy and Scott

45:16.960 --> 45:19.480
and our alliance
with Michael and Adam.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.960
If that Early Checkout Card
comes through our door this evening,

45:36.960 --> 45:37.960
it's war.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.960
